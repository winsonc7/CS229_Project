At time $t=0$, the particle's position $\\vec{r}=$ $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\hat{i}+\\sqrt{2} \\hat{j}\\right) m$ and its velocity $\\vec{v}=\\left(-\\sqrt{2} \\hat{i}+\\sqrt{2} \\hat{j}+\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\hat{k}\\right) m s^{-1}$. Let $v_{x}$ and $v_{y}$ denote the $x$ and the $y$ components of the particle's velocity, respectively. Ignore gravity. When $z=0.5 \\mathrm{~m}$, what is the value of $\\left(x v_{y}-y v_{x}\\right)$ in $m^{2} s^{-1}$?",
