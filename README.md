We ended up having some trouble submitting as gradescope only allowed us to submit one branch at a time instead of the whole repository. We've copied Winson's files from the feature-from-data 
branch into this branch for gradescope submission. Ronny's files are in the Embeddings and Clustering folder
Please ignore the Miscellaneous folder. It does not contain code relevant to the submission
