Using this expression, we can analyze the given statements:\n\n(A) Relative change in the radii of two consecutive orbitals does not depend on $Z$: This statement is false. The relative change in radii between two consecutive orbitals is given by $\\frac{\\Delta r}{r} = \\frac{r_{n+1}-r_n}{r_n} = \\frac{(n+1)^2-n^2}{n^2} = \\frac{2n+1}{n^2}$.

From the expression derived above, we see that $\\frac{\\Delta r}{r} = \\frac{2n+1}{n^2} \\approx \\frac{2}{n}$ for large $n$. Therefore, the relative change in radii decreases as $1/n$.\n\n(C) Relative change in the energy of two consecutive orbitals varies as $1/n^3$: This statement is also true. The energy of the $n$th state is given by $E_n = -\\frac{Z^2}{n^2} \\frac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass. The energy difference between two consecutive states is $\\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n = \\frac{Z^2}{n^2(n+1)^2} \\frac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}$. Therefore, the relative change in energy is $\\frac{\\Delta E}{E} = \\frac{1}{n(n+1)} \\approx \\frac{1}{n^2}$ for large $n$, which varies as $1/n^3$.\n\n(D) Relative change in the angular momenta of two consecutive orbitals varies as $1/n$: This statement is false. The angular momentum of the $n$th state is given by $L_n = n \\hbar$. Therefore, the relative change in angular momentum between two consecutive states is $\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{L_{n+1}-L_n}{L_n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{n\\hbar} = \\frac{1}{n}$.

When a hydrogen atom absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher energy level. When it emits a photon, it transitions back down to a lower energy level. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the difference in energy between the two levels.\n\nIn this problem, the hydrogen atom is in its ground state and is irradiated by light of wavelength 970 A. The energy of the photon is therefore:\n\n$$E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = \\frac{(1.237 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{m})(3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m/s})}{970 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 12.8 \\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe ground state energy of the hydrogen atom is $-13.6 \\mathrm{eV}$, so the emitted photon has an energy of:\n\n$$\\Delta E = -13.6 \\mathrm{eV} - (-12.8 \\mathrm{eV}) = -0.8 \\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe emission spectrum of hydrogen consists of a series of lines corresponding to different transitions between energy levels. The energy of each line is given by:\n\n$$\\Delta E = -\\frac{13.6 \\mathrm{eV}}{n_f^2} + \\frac{13.6 \\mathrm{eV}}{n_i^2}$$\n\nwhere $n_i$ and $n_f$ are the initial and final energy levels, respectively. The lines in the emission spectrum correspond to transitions where $n_f$ is fixed and $n_i$ takes on different values. The lowest energy line corresponds to the transition where $n_f = 2$, and the next lowest energy line corresponds to the transition where $n_f = 3$, and so on.\n\nTo find the number of lines in the emission spectrum, we need to find the largest value of $n_i$ such that the corresponding energy level is still less than $-0.8 \\mathrm{eV}$. Solving the equation above for $n_i$ and plugging in $\\Delta E = -0.8 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $n_f = 1$, we get:\n\n$$n_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{13.6 \\mathrm{eV}}{13.6 \\mathrm{eV} + 0.8 \\mathrm{eV}}} \\approx 3.5$$\n\nTherefore, the largest value of $n_i$ that gives a transition with energy less than $-0.8 \\mathrm{eV}$ is $n_i = 3$. The emission spectrum of hydrogen therefore has $3 - 1 + 1 = \\boxed{3}$ lines."

                        "content": "We can start by finding the equivalent resistance of the circuit. Since the components are in parallel, the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R_{L_1}} + \\frac{1}{R_{L_2}}\n$$\nwhere $R_{L_1}$ and $R_{L_2}$ are the total resistances of the inductors. The total resistance of an inductor is the sum of its internal resistance and the resistance due to its inductance, which is given by $L\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the current. At time $t=0$, the current is zero, so the angular frequency is also zero. Therefore, the total resistance of each inductor is just its internal resistance. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{12\\Omega} + \\frac{1}{3\\Omega} + \\frac{1}{4\\Omega} = \\frac{11}{24}\\frac{1}{\\Omega}\n$$\nSo the equivalent resistance is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{24}{11}\\Omega \\approx 2.18\\Omega\n$$\nThe current drawn from the battery is given by Ohm's law:\n$$\nI = \\frac{V}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{5\\mathrm{~V}}{\\frac{24}{11}\\Omega} = \\frac{55}{24}\\mathrm{~A} \\approx 2.29\\mathrm{~A}\n$$\nTo find the maximum and minimum currents, we need to consider the behavior of the inductors. When the circuit is switched on, the inductors will initially act as short circuits, since the current cannot change instantaneously. As the current increases, the inductors will start to oppose the change in current, which will cause the current to decrease. Eventually, the current will stabilize at a constant value determined by the equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n\nThe time constant of an inductor is given by $L/R$, where $L$ is the inductance and $R$ is the resistance. The time constant represents the time it takes for the current to reach $63.2\\%$ of its final value. The time constant of $L_1$ is $1\\mathrm{~ms}/3\\Omega = 0.33\\mathrm{~ms}$, and the time constant of $L_2$ is $2\\mathrm{~ms}/4\\Omega = 0.5\\mathrm{~ms}$. Since $L_2$ has a larger time constant, it will take longer to reach its final value, and its current will be smaller than the current in $L_1$ during the transient period.\n\nTo find the maximum current, we can assume that the inductors have reached their steady-state values, and that the current is determined solely by the equivalent resistance of the circuit. The maximum current occurs when the equivalent resistance is at its minimum, which is when the inductors are acting as short circuits. In this case, the maximum current is:\n$$\nI_{\\max} = \\frac{V}{R_{L_1} + R_{L_2} + R} = \\frac{5\\mathrm{~V}}{3\\Omega + 4\\Omega + 12\\Omega} = \\frac{5}{19}\\mathrm{~A} \\approx 0.26\\mathrm{~A}\n$$\nTo find the minimum current, we need to consider the transient behavior of the inductors. At time $t=0$, the current is zero, so the inductors act as short circuits. As the current increases, the inductors start to oppose the change in current, which causes the current to decrease. The minimum current occurs when the current has just started to decrease, which is when the inductors are starting to have an effect on the circuit. At this point, the current in $L_2$ will be smaller than the current in $L_1$, since $L_2$ has a larger time constant. Therefore, the minimum current is:\n$$\nI_{\\min} = \\frac{V}{R_{L_1} + R_{L_2} + R} \\frac{L_1}{L_1 + L_2} = \\frac{5\\mathrm{~V}}{3\\Omega + 4\\Omega + 12\\Omega} \\frac{1\\mathrm{~mH}}{1\\mathrm{~mH} + 2\\mathrm{~mH}} \\approx 0.087\\mathrm{~A}\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the maximum to minimum current is:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\max}}{I_{\\min}} = \\frac{0.26\\mathrm{~A}}{0.087\\mathrm{~A}} \\approx 2.99\n$$\nSo the ratio is approximately $2.99$."

If the configuration has unpaired electrons, the compound is paramagnetic, otherwise it is diamagnetic.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n$[\\mathrm{Ni(CO)}_{4}]$: The nickel ion has a d$^8$ configuration, which can be written as $\\mathrm{[Ar] 3d^8 4s^2}$. There are two unpaired electrons in the d subshell, so this compound is paramagnetic.\n\n$[\\mathrm{NiCl}_{4}]^{2-}$: The nickel ion has a d$^8$ configuration, as in the previous compound. However, the chloride ions are strong-field ligands, which cause the d orbitals to split into two sets of different energies. This results in pairing of the electrons in the lower-energy set, so there are no unpaired electrons. Therefore, this compound is diamagnetic.\n\n$[\\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_{4}Cl_2}]\\mathrm{Cl}$: The cobalt ion has a d$^7$ configuration, which can be written as $\\mathrm{[Ar] 3d^7 4s^2}$. There is one unpaired electron in the d subshell, so this compound is paramagnetic.\n\n$\\mathrm{Na_3}[\\mathrm{CoF_6}]$: The cobalt ion has a d$^6$ configuration, which can be written as $\\mathrm{[Ar] 3d^6 4s^2}$. There are no unpaired electrons in the d subshell, so this compound is diamagnetic.\n\n$\\mathrm{Na_2O_2}$: The oxygen atoms in this compound have a stable closed-shell configuration of 2s$^2$2p$^4$, so they do not contribute to the magnetic properties. The sodium ions have a noble gas configuration of $\\mathrm{[Ne]}$, which does not have any unpaired electrons. Therefore, this compound is diamagnetic.\n\n$\\mathrm{CsO_2}$: The oxygen atoms have a stable closed-shell configuration, as in the previous compound. The cesium ion has a noble gas configuration of $\\mathrm{[Xe]}$, which does not have any unpaired electrons. Therefore, this compound is diamagnetic.\n\nSo, out of the six compounds, only $[\\mathrm{Ni(CO)}_{4}]$ and $[\\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_{4}Cl_2}]\\mathrm{Cl}$ are paramagnetic. The answer is (A) 2."

This gives us:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{3}\\sin x+2\\cos x-2\\cos 2x&=0\\\\\n\\sqrt{3}\\sin x+2\\cos x-4\\cos^2 x+2&=2\\\\\n(\\sqrt{3}\\sin x+2\\cos x)(2\\cos x-1)&=2\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we can solve for $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ using the identity $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin^2 x &= 1 - \\cos^2 x\\\\\n3\\sin^2 x &= 3 - 3\\cos^2 x\\\\\n\\sqrt{3}\\sin x &= \\sqrt{3-3\\cos^2 x}\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{3-3\\cos^2 x}+2\\cos x(2\\cos x-1)&=2\\\\\n\\sqrt{3-3\\cos^2 x}+4\\cos^2 x-2\\cos x&=2\\\\\n\\sqrt{3-3\\cos^2 x}&=2\\cos x-2\\cos^2 x\\\\\n3-3\\cos^2 x&=4\\cos^4 x-8\\cos^3 x+4\\cos^2 x\\\\\n4\\cos^4 x-8\\cos^3 x+7\\cos^2 x-3&=0\\\\\n(2\\cos x-1)(2\\cos x-3)(2\\cos^2 x-\\cos x-3)&=0\n\\end{align*}\nThe solutions to the equation are the solutions to the three factors above. However, we need to check which solutions are in $S$. The solutions to $2\\cos x-1=0$ are $x=\\frac{\\pi}{3},\\frac{5\\pi}{3}$, but only $x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ is in $S$. The solutions to $2\\cos x-3=0$ are $x=\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\frac{11\\pi}{6}$, but only $x=\\frac{11\\pi}{6}$ is in $S$. Finally, the solutions to $2\\cos^2 x-\\cos x-3=0$ can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos x &= \\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{25}}{4}\\\\\n\\cos x &= \\frac{3}{4},-\\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nThe solution $\\cos x = \\frac{3}{4}$ gives $x=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{5}$, but only $x=\\frac{\\pi}{5}$ is in $S$. The solution $\\cos x = -\\frac{1}{2}$ gives $x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3},\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$, but neither of these are in $S$. Therefore, the solutions in $S$ are $x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $x=\\frac{11\\pi}{6}$, and their sum is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\frac{11\\pi}{6}=\\frac{5\\pi}{2}$. However, we need to subtract the excluded values $x=0,\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ from this sum, giving $\\frac{5\\pi}{2}-\\left(0+\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{5\\pi}{9}}$."

Thus, $\\angle OSQ=\\angle QSR$ and $\\triangle OSQ\\sim\\triangle QSR$. Therefore, $OQ^2=QS\\cdot QR=6\\cdot 3\\sqrt{2}=18\\sqrt{2}$. Also, $OR=3$ and $\\angle QOR=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $\\angle OQR=\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{18}}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Thus, $\\angle OQS=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $\\angle OQR+\\angle RQS=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

Thus, $\\det(Q)=\\frac{k^2}{2}$.\n\nWe are given that $q_{23}=-\\frac{k}{8}$. Let $Q'=\\operatorname{adj}(Q)$ be the adjugate of $Q$. Then, $QQ'=\\det(Q)I$. Taking determinants of both sides, we have $\\det(QQ')=\\det(Q)\\det(Q')=(\\det(Q))^3=k^6$. On the other hand, $\\det(QQ')=\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(Q)Q)=\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(P))\\det(Q)$. Thus, $\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(P))=\\frac{k^3}{\\det(Q)}=\\frac{2}{k}$.\n\nNow, we can use these results to check each option:\n\n(A) $\\alpha=0, k=8$: In this case, $P$ becomes $P=\\begin{bmatrix}3 & -1 & -2 \\\\ 2 & 0 & 8 \\\\ 3 & -5 & 0\\end{bmatrix}$.

We can then verify that $\\det(Q)=32$ and $\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(P))=\\frac{1}{4}$, so option (A) is not correct.\n\n(B) $4 \\alpha-k+8=0$: Using the fact that $\\det(PQ)=k^3$, we have $\\det(Q)=\\frac{k^2}{2}=\\frac{\\det(PQ)}{2}=\\frac{\\det(P)\\det(Q)}{2}=\\frac{\\det(P)\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(P))}{2}$. Substituting $\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(P))=\\frac{2}{k}$, we get $\\det(Q)=\\frac{\\det(P)}{k}$. Expanding the determinant of $P$, we get $\\det(P)=-\\alpha k^2$, so $\\det(Q)=-\\frac{\\alpha k}{k}=-\\alpha$. Using the given value of $q_{23}$, we can solve for $q_{22}$ and $q_{32}$ in terms of $k$ and $\\alpha$. Then, using the fact that $\\det(Q)=\\frac{k^2}{2}$, we can solve for $q_{33}$ in terms of $k$ and $\\alpha$. Finally, we can use the equation $PQ=kI$ to solve for $q_{11}$, $q_{12}$, $q_{13}$, $q_{21}$, $q_{31}$, and $q_{33}$ in terms of $k$ and $\\alpha$. Substituting these values into the equation $4 \\alpha-k+8=0$, we find that it is satisfied, so option (B) is correct.\n\n(C) $\\operatorname{det}(P \\operatorname{adj}(Q))=2^{9}$: Using the fact that $\\det(P\\operatorname{adj}(Q))=\\det(P)\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(Q))$, we have $\\det(P\\operatorname{adj}(Q))=\\det(P)\\det(Q')=\\det(P)\\frac{\\det(Q)}{\\det(Q)}=\\det(P)$. We can compute $\\det(P)$ as $-\\alpha k^2$. Thus, we need $-\\alpha k^2=512$, which cannot be satisfied since $k$ is nonzero. Therefore, option (C) is not correct.\n\n(D) $\\operatorname{det}(Q \\operatorname{adj}(P))=2^{13}$: Using the fact that $\\det(Q\\operatorname{adj}(P))=\\det(Q)\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(P))$, we have $\\det(Q\\operatorname{adj}(P))=\\det(Q)\\frac{2}{k}=\\frac{k^2}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{k}=k$. We can compute $k$ as $\\sqrt[3]{\\det(PQ)}=\\sqrt[3]{k^3}=k$. Thus, we need $k=2^{13}$, which is satisfied if we take $\\alpha=8192$ and $k=2^{13}$. We can then verify that the given value of $q_{23}$ is satisfied, and that $\\det(Q)=2^{26}$ and $\\det(\\operatorname{adj}(P))=\\frac{1}{2^{13}}$, so option (D) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are (B) and (D)."

Therefore, $P=(\\sqrt{2},1)$.\n\nNext, we find the equation of the tangent to $C_1$ at $P$. Differentiating the equation of $C_1$, we get $2x+2y\\frac{dy}{dx}=0$, so $\\frac{dy}{dx}=-\\frac{x}{y}$. At $P$, we have $\\frac{dy}{dx}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1}=-\\sqrt{2}$, so the equation of the tangent is $y-1=-\\sqrt{2}(x-\\sqrt{2})$, or $y=-\\sqrt{2}x+3$.\n\nNow, we find the coordinates of $R_2$ and $R_3$. Since $C_2$ and $C_3$ are tangent to the tangent at $P$, their centres $Q_2$ and $Q_3$ lie on the line perpendicular to the tangent at $P$ and passing through its midpoint. The midpoint of the tangent at $P$ is $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+2}{2},2\\right)$, so the line perpendicular to the tangent at $P$ passing through this point is $y=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}x+3$. Since $Q_2$ and $Q_3$ lie on the $y$-axis, their coordinates are $(0,a)$ and $(0,b)$, respectively, where $a$ and $b$ are constants to be determined. Solving the system of equations $a=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(0)+3$ and $b=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(0)+3$ (since the line passes through $(0,3)$), we get $a=3$ and $b=3$. Therefore, $Q_2=(0,3)$ and $Q_3=(0,3)$.\n\nSince $C_2$ and $C_3$ have equal radii $2\\sqrt{3}$, their equations are $(x-0)^2+(y-3)^2=12$ and $(x-0)^2+(y-3)^2=12$, respectively. Substituting $y=-\\sqrt{2}x+3$ into these equations, we get the coordinates of $R_2$ and $R_3$ as $(2+\\sqrt{6},1-\\sqrt{6})$ and $(2-\\sqrt{6},1+\\sqrt{6})$, respectively.\n\nFinally, we find the areas of triangles $OR_2R_3$ and $PQ_2Q_3$. The coordinates of $O$ are $(0,0)$. Using the Shoelace Formula, we get the area of triangle $OR_2R_3$ as $\\frac{1}{2}|(0)(1-\\sqrt{6})+(2+\\sqrt{6})(3)+(2-\\sqrt{6})(3)-(0)(1+\\sqrt{6})|=6\\sqrt{2}$, so option (C) is correct.\n\nUsing the distance formula, we get $Q_2Q_3=|3-3|=0$, so option (A) is incorrect. Using the distance formula again, we get $R_2R_3=\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{6}-(2-\\sqrt{6}))^2+(1-\\sqrt{6}-(1+\\sqrt{6}))^2}=4\\sqrt{6}$, so option (B) is correct.\n\nFinally, using the distance formula once more, we get $PQ_2=\\sqrt{(0-\\sqrt{2})^2+(3-1)^2}=2\\sqrt{2}$ and $PQ_3=\\sqrt{(0-\\sqrt{2})^2+(3-1)^2}=2\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of triangle $PQ_2Q_3$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\sqrt{2})(2\\sqrt{2})=4$, so option (D) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are (B) and (C)."

Therefore, the equation of $OR$ is $x=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet $P$ be a point on the circle other than $R$ and $S$. Let $T$ be the point of intersection of $OR$ and $PQ$. Since $OR$ is perpendicular to $PT$, we have $PT\\parallel RS$. Let $E'$ be the point of intersection of $PQ$ and the normal to the circle at $P$. Then $E'P$ is perpendicular to $PE'$, so $PE'$ is parallel to $TS$. Therefore, $E'$ lies on the line through $Q$ parallel to $RS$, and hence $E'=E$.\n\nLet $P$ have coordinates $(x,y)$. Then the equation of the tangent to the circle at $P$ is $x_{1} x+y_{1} y=1$, where $(x_{1},y_{1})$ is the unit vector in the direction of the normal to the circle at $P$. Since the circle has center $(0,0)$, the normal to the circle at $P$ passes through $P$ and has slope $-\\frac{x}{y}$.

Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get $x^{2}(x^{2}-1)=\\frac{4}{5}(x^{2}-\\frac{1}{2})$. Therefore, $x^{2}=\\frac{1}{5}$ or $x^{2}=1$. Since $P$ is not equal to $S$, we have $x^{2}\\neq 1$.

The normal to the circle at $P$ has equation $y=\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5}}x$. Therefore, the point $E$ of intersection of this normal and the line through $Q$ parallel to $RS$ has coordinates $(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$.\n\nLet $P$ have coordinates $(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}},\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}})$. Then $Q$ has coordinates $(1,-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}})$, and the normal to the circle at $P$ has equation $y=\\frac{2}{3}+\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5}}x$. Therefore, the point $E$ of intersection of this normal and the line through $Q$ parallel to $RS$ has coordinates $(\\frac{1}{3},-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$.\n\nTherefore, the locus of $E$ is the set of points $\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.

Therefore, the equation $f(x) = 2x-1$ can have at most one solution in the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nTo see that there is at least one solution, note that $f(1/2) = \\int_{0}^{1/2} \\frac{t^{2}}{1+t^{4}} d t > 0$ and $2(1/2)-1 = 0$. Therefore, there is at least one solution to $f(x) = 2x-1$ in the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nCombining all of these results, we conclude that there is exactly one solution to $f(x) = 2x-1$ in the interval $[0,1]$. Therefore, the total number of distinct $x \\in [0,1]$ that satisfy the given equation is $\\boxed{1}$."

The work done in this step is given by:\n$$\nW_{1}=P_{i} \\Delta V=P_{i}(V_{f}-V_{i})=10^{5}(8 \\times 10^{-3}-10^{-3})=0.8 \\mathrm{~J}\n$$\nThe second step is an isochoric process at $V_{f}=8 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$, which means that the volume remains constant at this value. Since the process is isochoric, no work is done. Therefore, the total work done in the two-step process is $W_{\\text {total}}=W_{1}+0.0.8=0.88 \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\nSince the two processes have the same initial and final states, the change in internal energy is the same in both cases, i.e., $\\Delta U = -\\frac{3}{2} \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~J}$. By the first law of thermodynamics, the amount of heat supplied to the system in the two-step process is given by:\n$$\nQ=\\Delta U+W_{\\text {total}}=-\\frac{3}{2} \\times 10^{3}+0.88=-\\frac{3}{2} \\times 10^{3}+880 \\mathrm{~J}=294 \\mathrm{~J}\n$$\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }294 \\mathrm{~J}}$."

Therefore, we have\n$$\n-k(x-x_{1})=ma\n$$\nor\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+\\frac{k}{m}(x-x_{1})=0\n$$\nThis is the equation of motion of a simple harmonic oscillator with time period\n$$\nT_{1}=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m+M}{k(M+m)}}\n$$\nThe amplitude of oscillation is $A$, which is the distance between the new equilibrium position and the old equilibrium position.

When the mass $m$ is placed on the block, the new equilibrium position shifts by a distance $\\Delta x = \\frac{mA}{M+m+A}$ (as the center of mass of the system shifts). Therefore, the new equilibrium position is $x_{0}+A+\\Delta x$. Let $x_{2}=x_{0}+A+\\Delta x$. The potential energy of the system at the new equilibrium position is\n$$\nU_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}k(x_{0}+A+\\Delta x-x_{0}-A)^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}k\\Delta x^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}k\\frac{m^{2}A^{2}}{(M+m+A)^{2}}\n$$\nThe total energy of the system at the new equilibrium position is\n$$\nE_{2}=U_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}k\\frac{m^{2}A^{2}}{(M+m+A)^{2}}\n$$\nWhen the block is displaced from the new equilibrium position by a small distance $x$, the force on the block due to the spring is given by Hooke's law as $F=-k(x-x_{2})$. The force on the block due to the mass $m$ is given by $F=ma$, where $a$ is the acceleration of the combined masses. Therefore, we have\n$$\n-k(x-x_{2})=ma\n$$\nor\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+\\frac{k}{m}(x-x_{2})=0\n$$\nThis is the equation of motion of a simple harmonic oscillator with time period\n$$\nT_{2}=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m+M+A}{k(M+m+A)}}\n$$\nThe amplitude of oscillation is $A$, which is the distance between the new equilibrium position and the old equilibrium position.

This leads to positive deviation from Raoult's law. Therefore, option (A) is correct.\n\n(B) Carbon disulphide + acetone\nThe intermolecular forces between carbon disulphide and acetone are similar in strength to the intermolecular forces between like molecules. This leads to little to no deviation from Raoult's law. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.\n\n(C) Benzene + toluene\nThe intermolecular forces between benzene and toluene are similar in strength to the intermolecular forces between like molecules. This leads to little to no deviation from Raoult's law. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.\n\n(D) Phenol + aniline\nThe intermolecular forces between phenol and aniline are stronger than the intermolecular forces between like molecules.

                        "content": "First, we need to find the image of the point $(3,1,7)$ with respect to the plane $x-y+z=3$. To do this, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane:\n\n$$d = \\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 + d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$$\n\nwhere $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is the point, $ax + by + cz + d = 0$ is the equation of the plane, and $d$ is the distance between the point and the plane.\n\nIn this case, the equation of the plane is $x-y+z=3$, so $a=1$, $b=-1$, $c=1$, and $d=-3$. Plugging in $(3,1,7)$, we get:\n\n$$d = \\frac{|1(3) - 1(1) + 1(7) - 3|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nThis means that the distance between the point $(3,1,7)$ and the plane $x-y+z=3$ is $2\\sqrt{3}$. To find the image of the point, we can move twice this distance in the opposite direction of the normal vector of the plane. The normal vector of the plane is $(1,-1,1)$, so we can find the image as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\1\\\\7\\end{pmatrix} - 2\\sqrt{3}\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\-1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3-2\\sqrt{3}\\\\1+2\\sqrt{3}\\\\7-2\\sqrt{3}\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nSo the image of the point $(3,1,7)$ with respect to the plane $x-y+z=3$ is $(3-2\\sqrt{3},1+2\\sqrt{3},7-2\\sqrt{3})$, which we will call $P$.\n\nNext, we need to find the equation of the plane passing through $P$ and containing the straight line $\\frac{x}{1}=\\frac{y}{2}=\\frac{z}{1}$. We can start by finding two points on the line. Letting $t$ be a parameter, we can set $x=t$, $y=2t$, and $z=t$, so the line can be parameterized as:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}t\\\\2t\\\\t\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nTwo points on this line are $\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ (when $t=0$) and $\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$ (when $t=1$).\n\nSince the plane we want passes through $P$, we know that it must contain the vector $\\begin{pmatrix}3-2\\sqrt{3}\\\\1+2\\sqrt{3}\\\\7-2\\sqrt{3}\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\1\\\\7\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\sqrt{3}\\\\2\\sqrt{3}\\\\-2\\sqrt{3}\\end{pmatrix}$. We can use this vector as the normal vector of the plane.\n\nTo find the equation of the plane, we can use the point-normal form:\n\n$$(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{a}) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}$ is a point on the plane, $\\mathbf{a}$ is a known point on the plane (in this case, $P$), and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the normal vector of the plane.\n\nPlugging in $\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix}3-2\\sqrt{3}\\\\1+2\\sqrt{3}\\\\7-2\\sqrt{3}\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{n} = \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\sqrt{3}\\\\2\\sqrt{3}\\\\-2\\sqrt{3}\\end{pmatrix}$, we get:\n\n$$(\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}3-2\\sqrt{3}\\\\1+2\\sqrt{3}\\\\7-2\\sqrt{3}\\end{pmatrix}) \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\sqrt{3}\\\\2\\sqrt{3}\\\\-2\\sqrt{3}\\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$-2\\sqrt{3}(x - (3-2\\sqrt{3})) + 2\\sqrt{3}(y - (1+2\\sqrt{3})) - 2\\sqrt{3}(z - (7-2\\sqrt{3})) = 0$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$x + y - 3z = 0$$\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }x+y-3z=0}$."

We can plot the graph of $f(x)$ as follows:\n\n[asy]\nsize(200);\nimport TrigMacros;\nrr_cartesian_axes(-0.7, 2.2, -4.2, 2.2, complexplane=false, usegrid=true);\nreal f(real x) { return(floor(x^2-3)); }\ndraw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*graph(f, -0.5, 2), red);\nlabel(\"$f(x)$\", (2.2, 0.2), red);\n[/asy]\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=-\\sqrt{3}$, $x=0$, and $x=\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, option (A) is correct and option (B) is incorrect.\n\nNext, let's analyze $g(x)$. We have $g(x)=|x| f(x)+|4 x-7| f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ takes integer values, we can split $g(x)$ into cases based on the sign of $x$ and $4x-7$:\n\nCase 1: $x \\leq 0$ and $4x-7 \\leq 0$\nIn this case, we have $g(x) = -x^2+3(4x-7) = -x^2+12x-21$. This is a quadratic function that is differentiable for all $x \\in \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}, 2\\right]$.

This is a quadratic function that is differentiable for all $x \\in \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}, 2\\right]$. Therefore, $g(x)$ is differentiable for $x \\leq 0$ and $4x-7 > 0$.\n\nCase 3: $x > 0$ and $4x-7 \\leq 0$\nIn this case, we have $g(x) = x^2+3(4x-7) = x^2+12x-21$. This is a quadratic function that is differentiable for all $x \\in \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}, 2\\right]$. Therefore, $g(x)$ is differentiable for $x > 0$ and $4x-7 \\leq 0$.\n\nCase 4: $x > 0$ and $4x-7 > 0$\nIn this case, we have $g(x) = x^2+3(7-4x) = -13x+x^2+21$. This is a quadratic function that is differentiable for all $x \\in \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}, 2\\right]$. Therefore, $g(x)$ is differentiable for $x > 0$ and $4x-7 > 0$.\n\nTherefore, $g(x)$ is differentiable for all $x \\in \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}, 2\\right]$, and options (C) and (D) are both incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct options are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$ and $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$."

                        "content": "First, we find the center of the circle. Completing the square, we have $(x-2)^2+(y-8)^2=20^2$. Therefore, the center is $(2,8)$ and the radius is $20$.\n\nNext, we find the coordinates of $P$. Let $P=(a,b)$. Then, the distance from $P$ to the center of the circle is $\\sqrt{(a-2)^2+(b-8)^2}$. We want to minimize this distance, subject to the constraint that $b^2=4a$. Using Lagrange multipliers, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(a,b)&=(a-2)^2+(b-8)^2\\\\\ng(a,b)&=b^2-4a\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nThe Lagrange multiplier equation is then\n\\[\\nabla f=\\lambda \\nabla g\\]\nwhich gives us the system of equations\n\\begin{align*}\n2(a-2)&=-4\\lambda a\\\\\n2(b-8)&=2\\lambda b\\\\\nb^2&=4a\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nSolving for $a$ and $b$, we get $a=\\frac{4}{5}$ and $b=\\pm\\frac{8}{5}\\sqrt{5}$. Since $P$ lies on the parabola $y^2=4x$, we take $b=\\frac{8}{5}\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nNow, we find the coordinates of $Q$. Since $Q$ divides $SP$ internally, we have $\\frac{SQ}{QP}=\\frac{r}{d}$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $d$ is the distance between $S$ and $P$. We already know that $r=20$. To find $d$, we use the distance formula:\n\\[d=\\sqrt{(a-2)^2+(b-8)^2}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\]\nTherefore, $\\frac{SQ}{QP}=\\frac{20}{\\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{5}}=5\\sqrt{5}$. Let $Q=(x,y)$. Then, we have the system of equations\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+y^2-4x-16y+64&=0\\\\\n\\frac{x-a}{5\\sqrt{5}}&=\\frac{2}{SQ+QP}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nSolving for $x$ and $y$, we get $x=\\frac{2}{5}(3+\\sqrt{5})$ and $y=\\frac{1}{5}(7+\\sqrt{5})$.\n\nTo find the $x$-intercept of the normal to the parabola at $P$, we need to find the equation of the normal. The slope of the tangent to the parabola at $P$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the slope of the normal is $-2$. Using point-slope form, the equation of the normal is\n\\[y-\\frac{8}{5}\\sqrt{5}=-2\\left(x-\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\]\nSetting $y=0$, we get $x=\\frac{6}{5}$.\n\nFinally, to find the slope of the tangent to the circle at $Q$, we take the derivative of the equation of the circle and evaluate it at $Q$. The equation of the circle is\n\\[x^2+y^2-4x-16y+64=0\\]\nTaking the derivative with respect to $x$, we get\n\\[2x+2y\\frac{dy}{dx}-4-16\\frac{dy}{dx}=0\\]\nEvaluating at $Q$, we get\n\\[2\\left(\\frac{2}{5}(3+\\sqrt{5})\\right)+2\\left(\\frac{1}{5}(7+\\sqrt{5})\\right)\\frac{dy}{dx}-4-16\\frac{dy}{dx}=0\\]\nSolving for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, we get $\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$\\Delta P \\propto u^3(u_{\\text{trailing}}^2 - u_{\\text{leading}}^2)$$\n\nNow, since the plate is moving normal to its plane, the gas molecules will bounce off the plate and change their momentum. This change in momentum will result in a force on the plate, which is proportional to the rate of change of momentum of the gas molecules. Since the gas molecules have a velocity of $u$ and are bouncing off the plate, the rate of change of momentum is proportional to $u^2$. Therefore, the force on the plate is proportional to $u^2$.

However, this force is not the resistive force experienced by the plate. The resistive force is the force that opposes the motion of the plate and is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force on the plate. Therefore, the resistive force is proportional to $u^2v$ and not just $v$. Therefore, option B is false.\n\nOption C: The plate will continue to move with constant non-zero acceleration, at all times.\n\nSince the force on the plate is proportional to $u^2v$, the acceleration of the plate is proportional to $u^2v/m$, where $m$ is the mass of the plate. Since $u$ is much larger than $v$, the acceleration of the plate is much smaller than the acceleration of the gas molecules. Therefore, the plate will not continue to move with constant non-zero acceleration, but will eventually reach a terminal velocity where the force on the plate is balanced by the resistive force. Therefore, option C is false.\n\nOption D: At a later time the external force $F$ balances the resistive force.\n\nAs explained above, the resistive force experienced by the plate is proportional to $u^2v$. Therefore, at a later time, the plate will reach a terminal velocity where the force on the plate is balanced by the resistive force. Therefore, option D is true.\n\nFinal answer: Options A and D are true."

                        "content": "[A] The amount of energy radiated by the body in 1 second can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit time per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. Thus, the energy radiated by the body per second is given by $E=\\sigma A(T^{4}-T_{0}^{4})$, where $A$ is the surface area of the body, $T$ is the body temperature, and $T_{0}$ is the room temperature. Substituting the given values, we get $E=\\sigma(1 \\mathrm{~m}^{2})(313^{4}-300^{4}) \\approx 60 \\mathrm{~J}$, which means option [A] is correct.\n\n[B] To maintain the same body temperature, the energy radiated by the body must be equal to the energy absorbed from the surroundings. If the surrounding temperature reduces by a small amount $\\Delta T_{0}$, then the energy absorbed by the body reduces by $\\sigma A(T^{4}-(T_{0}-\\Delta T_{0})^{4}) \\approx 4 \\sigma A T_{0}^{3} \\Delta T_{0}$. Thus, to maintain the same body temperature, the body needs to radiate $\\Delta W=4 \\sigma T_{0}^{3} \\Delta T_{0}$ more energy per unit time. Therefore, option [B] is correct.\n\n[C] Reducing the exposed surface area of the body reduces the amount of energy lost by radiation, as the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. Thus, reducing the surface area reduces the amount of energy radiated by the body, which helps in maintaining the same body temperature. Therefore, option [C] is correct.\n\n[D] Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. Thus, if the body temperature rises significantly, the peak in the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the body would shift to shorter wavelengths, not longer wavelengths. Therefore, option [D] is incorrect.\n\nHence, the correct options are [A], [B], and [C]."

Therefore, we can assume that the activity of ${ }^{131} \\mathrm{I}$ in the blood is constant during the 11.5 hours. Let this constant activity be denoted by $A_c$. Then, we have:\n\n$$A_c \\cdot V_b = A(0) \\cdot V_i$$\n\nwhere $V_b$ is the total volume of blood in the person's body and $V_i$ is the volume of the injected serum. We know that $V_i$ is small and can be neglected compared to $V_b$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$A_c \\approx \\frac{A(0)}{V_b}$$\n\nUsing the values of $A(0)$ and $A(11.5 \\mathrm{~hours})$ that we calculated earlier, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{2.4 \\times 10^5}{V_b} \\approx \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^4}{2.5 \\times 10^{-6}}$$\n\nwhere we have converted the volume of blood drawn from the person's body to liters. Solving for $V_b$, we get:\n\n$$V_b \\approx \\frac{2.4 \\times 10^5}{\\frac{1.2 \\times 10^4}{2.5 \\times 10^{-6}}} \\approx 5 \\mathrm{~liters}$$\n\nTherefore, the total volume of blood in the person's body is approximately $\\boxed{5}$ liters."

The work done on the gas is maximum when it is compressed reversibly, not irreversibly. In an irreversible process, some energy is lost as heat, which reduces the work done on the gas.\n\n[B] If the expansion is carried out freely, it is simultaneously both isothermal as well as adiabatic\n\nThis statement is incorrect. If the expansion is carried out freely, it is an adiabatic process, not an isothermal process. In an adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange between the system and the surroundings, so the temperature of the gas changes.\n\n[C] The work done by the gas is less when it is expanded reversibly from $\\mathrm{V}_{1}$ to $\\mathrm{V}_{2}$ under adiabatic conditions as compared to that when expanded reversibly from $V_{1}$ to $\\mathrm{V}_{2}$ under isothermal conditions\n\nThis statement is correct. The work done by the gas is given by the area under the pressure-volume curve. For an adiabatic process, the pressure and volume are related by $pV^{\\gamma}=$ constant, where $\\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats. For an isothermal process, the pressure and volume are related by $pV=$ constant. Since $V_{2}>V_{1}$, the pressure is lower for the adiabatic process than for the isothermal process. Therefore, the area under the pressure-volume curve is less for the adiabatic process, which means that less work is done by the gas.\n\n[D] The change in internal energy of the gas is (i) zero, if it is expanded reversibly with $\\mathrm{T}_{1}=\\mathrm{T}_{2}$, and (ii) positive, if it is expanded reversibly under adiabatic conditions with $\\mathrm{T}_{1} \\neq \\mathrm{T}_{2}$\n\nThis statement is correct. The change in internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, not on the process by which it is expanded or compressed. For an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant, so the change in internal energy is zero. For an adiabatic process, the temperature changes, so the change in internal energy is positive. Therefore, statement (i) is correct and statement (ii) is also correct.\n\nFinal Answer: The correct statements are (C) and (D)."

When two helium atoms combine to form $\\mathrm{He}_{2}{ }^{+}$, one electron is lost from each atom, leaving a total of two electrons in the molecule. These two electrons are in the 1s orbital and are paired, making $\\mathrm{He}_{2}{ }^{+}$ a diamagnetic ion. \n\n- $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}$: The electron configuration of lithium is [He] 2s$^{1}$. When two lithium atoms combine to form $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}$, the two valence electrons (in the 2s orbital) pair up to form a diamagnetic molecule. \n\n- $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}$: The electron configuration of beryllium is [He] 2s$^{2}$. When two beryllium atoms combine to form $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}$, the four valence electrons (two in the 2s orbital and two in the 2p orbital) pair up to form a diamagnetic molecule. \n\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{2}$: The electron configuration of boron is [He] 2s$^{2}$ 2p$^{1}$. When two boron atoms combine to form $\\mathrm{B}_{2}$, the two valence electrons in the 2s orbital pair up, but the electron in the 2p orbital is unpaired, making $\\mathrm{B}_{2}$ a paramagnetic molecule. \n\n- $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$: The electron configuration of carbon is [He] 2s$^{2}$ 2p$^{2}$. When two carbon atoms combine to form $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$, the two valence electrons in the 2s orbital pair up, and two of the valence electrons in the 2p orbital pair up, leaving two unpaired electrons. Therefore, $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is a paramagnetic molecule. \n\n- $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$: The electron configuration of nitrogen is [He] 2s$^{2}$ 2p$^{3}$. When two nitrogen atoms combine to form $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, the two valence electrons in the 2s orbital pair up, and three of the valence electrons in the 2p orbital pair up, leaving one unpaired electron.

When two fluorine atoms combine to form $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$, the two valence electrons in the 2s orbital pair up, and four of the valence electrons in the 2p orbital pair up, leaving one unpaired electron.

Thus, if $A$ has coordinates $(a,b)$, then $B$ has coordinates $(2h-a,2k-b)$, and the midpoint $M$ has coordinates $(h,k)$, so we have \\begin{align*}\nh &= \\frac{a+(2h-a)}{2} = h, \\\\\nk &= \\frac{b+(2k-b)}{2} = k.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, $h$ and $k$ are the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the midpoint of the chord, respectively.\n\nSince the chord is not a tangent, it intersects the parabola at two distinct points. Let $A$ and $B$ be these points of intersection, and let $P$ be the point where the tangent to the parabola at $A$ intersects the $x$-axis. Then, by symmetry, the tangent to the parabola at $B$ intersects the $x$-axis at the same point $P$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\nimport graph;\nreal f(real x)\n{\nreturn sqrt(16*x);\n}\nreal g(real x)\n{\nreturn -sqrt(16*x);\n}\nreal xMin = -2;\nreal xMax = 6;\nreal yMin = -6;\nreal yMax = 6;\ndraw((xMin,0)--(xMax,0),black+linewidth(1.5),EndArrow(5));\ndraw((0,yMin)--(0,yMax),black+linewidth(1.5),EndArrow(5));\nreal xScale = 1;\nreal yScale = 1;\ndraw(graph(f,xMin,xMax),red+linewidth(1.5));\ndraw(graph(g,xMin,xMax),red+linewidth(1.5));\nlabel(\"$y^2=16x$\",(xMax,f(xMax)),E,red);\npair A = (-1,4);\npair B = (5,-2);\ndraw(A--B,blue+linewidth(1.5));\npair M = midpoint(A--B);\ndot(M,blue+linewidth(3));\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,NW,blue);\ndraw((M.x,yMin)--(M.x,yMax),dashed);\nlabel(\"$x=h$\",(M.x,yMax),N);\nlabel(\"$y=k$\",(xMax,k),E);\ndraw((0,4)--(-1,4),dashed);\ndraw((0,-2)--(5,-2),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW,black);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE,black);\npair P = (2,0);\ndot(P,black+linewidth(3));\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,S,black);\ndraw(A--P,black+linewidth(1.5));\ndraw(B--P,black+linewidth(1.5));\n[/asy]\n\nSince $A$ lies on the parabola, we have $A=(t^2,4t)$ for some $t$. Since the tangent to the parabola at $A$ is vertical, the $x$-coordinate of $P$ is $t^2$. Since $P$ lies on the $x$-axis, its $y$-coordinate is 0, so we have $P=(t^2,0)$. Since $P$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we have $B=(2t^2-t,0)$. Substituting these coordinates into the equation of the chord, we get \\[2t^2-t+4t=p.\\] Rearranging, we get $t^2-\\frac{1}{2}t+\\frac{p}{2}=0$. Since $A$ and $B$ are distinct points of intersection, this quadratic must have two distinct roots, so its discriminant is positive: \\[\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2-4\\cdot 1\\cdot \\frac{p}{2}>0.\\] Simplifying, we get $1-p>0$, or $p<1$.\n\nFinally, we check which of the given answer choices satisfy $p<1$. The only such answer choice is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }p=-1, h=1, k=-3}$."

Adsorption is accompanied by a decrease in entropy of the system but the enthalpy change can be either positive or negative depending on the nature of the adsorbate and adsorbent.\n\n[B] The critical temperatures of ethane and nitrogen are $563 \\mathrm{~K}$ and $126 \\mathrm{~K}$, respectively. The adsorption of ethane will be more than that of nitrogen on the same amount of activated charcoal at a given temperature - This statement is correct. The adsorption of a gas on a solid surface depends on the critical temperature of the gas and the temperature of the system. The gas with a higher critical temperature is adsorbed more readily at a given temperature. Since the critical temperature of ethane is higher than that of nitrogen, ethane will be adsorbed more readily on activated charcoal at a given temperature.\n\n[C] Cloud is an emulsion type of colloid in which liquid is dispersed phase and gas is dispersion medium - This statement is incorrect. A cloud is a type of aerosol colloid in which liquid water droplets are dispersed in a gas (air).\n\n[D] Brownian motion of colloidal particles does not depend on the size of the particles but depends on the viscosity of the solution - This statement is incorrect. Brownian motion is the random movement of colloidal particles due to collisions with solvent molecules. The magnitude of Brownian motion depends on the size of the particles and the viscosity of the solution. Smaller particles experience more Brownian motion than larger particles, and particles in more viscous solutions experience less Brownian motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is [B]."

It takes into account the orientation of the colliding molecules and the availability of the reaction sites. The value of $P$ depends on the nature of the reactants and the reaction conditions.\n\nOption [A]: The activation energy of a reaction is independent of the steric factor. It is a characteristic property of the reaction and depends only on the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state. Therefore, option [A] is correct.\n\nOption [B]: The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant $k$ of a reaction to the activation energy $E_a$, the frequency factor $A$, and the temperature $T$:\n\n$$k = A e^{-E_a/RT}$$\n\nThe frequency factor $A$ is related to the collision frequency and the fraction of collisions that have enough energy to overcome the activation barrier. It is independent of the steric factor. Therefore, if the experimentally determined value of $P$ is higher than expected, it means that the effective collision frequency is lower than predicted by the Arrhenius equation. This could be due to factors such as the presence of inhibitors or the formation of non-reactive complexes. Therefore, option [B] is correct.\n\nOption [C]: A steric factor of 4.5 means that only 4.5% of collisions result in a reaction. This does not mean that the reaction will not proceed without a catalyst. It only means that the reaction rate will be slower than expected based on the collision frequency. A catalyst can increase the effective collision frequency by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. Therefore, option [C] is incorrect.\n\nOption [D]: As mentioned earlier, the frequency factor $A$ is independent of the steric factor. Therefore, the value of $A$ predicted by the Arrhenius equation should be the same as the experimentally determined value, assuming that the reaction conditions are the same. Therefore, option [D] is incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the correct options are [A] and [B]."

First, we can square both sides to get rid of the square roots:\n\\begin{align*}\n64x(9+\\sqrt{x})dy^2 &= \\frac{1}{4+\\sqrt{9+\\sqrt{x}}}dx^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 256x(9+\\sqrt{x})dy^2 &= \\frac{dx^2}{(4+\\sqrt{9+\\sqrt{x}})^2}\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides and simplify the denominator:\n\\begin{align*}\n16\\sqrt{x}(3+\\sqrt{x})dy &= \\frac{dx}{4+\\sqrt{9+\\sqrt{x}}} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 16\\sqrt{x}(3+\\sqrt{x})dy &= \\frac{(4-\\sqrt{9+\\sqrt{x}})dx}{7+\\sqrt{x}}\n\\end{align*}\nThis looks like a good candidate for substitution. Let $u = 9+\\sqrt{x}$, so that $x = (u-9)^2$. Then, $dx = 2(u-9)du$, and we can rewrite the differential equation as:\n\\begin{align*}\n16(u-9)dy &= \\frac{(4-\\sqrt{u})2(u-9)du}{7+\\sqrt{(u-9)^2+9}} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 8(u-9)dy &= \\frac{(4-\\sqrt{u})du}{\\sqrt{u+9}}\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we can use separation of variables:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{8(u-9)}{(4-\\sqrt{u})}\\frac{dy}{du} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u+9}} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 8\\int\\frac{(u-9)}{(4-\\sqrt{u})}du &= \\int\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u+9}}dy \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 8\\int\\frac{(u-9)(4+\\sqrt{u})}{7}du &= 2\\sqrt{u+9}+C\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We can simplify the integral on the left-hand side by using long division or partial fractions:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(u-9)(4+\\sqrt{u})}{7} &= \\frac{4}{7}(u-9) + \\frac{1}{7}(u-9)^{3/2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{7}(u-9) + \\frac{1}{7}(x-256)^{3/4}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere we substituted back $x = (u-9)^2 = (x-256)^{1/2}$. Plugging this into the previous equation and solving for $y$, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n8\\left[\\frac{4}{7}(u-9) + \\frac{1}{7}(x-256)^{3/4}\\right] &= 2\\sqrt{u+9}+C \\\\\n\\Rightarrow y &= \\frac{1}{8}\\left[\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{u+9} + \\frac{1}{21}(x-256)^{3/4}\\sqrt{u+9}\\right] + \\frac{C}{8}\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the initial condition $y(0) = \\sqrt{7}$, we can solve for $C$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{7} &= \\frac{1}{8}\\left[\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{9} + \\frac{1}{21}(256)^{3/4}\\sqrt{9}\\right] + \\frac{C}{8} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow C &= 8\\sqrt{7} - \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{9} - \\frac{1}{21}(256)^{3/4}\\sqrt{9}\n\\end{align*}\nFinally, we can evaluate $y(256)$ using the formula we derived earlier:\n\\begin{align*}\ny(256) &= \\frac{1}{8}\\left[\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{265} + \\frac{1}{21}(256-256)^{3/4}\\sqrt{265}\\right] + \\frac{C}{8} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{8}\\left[\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{265}\\right] + \\frac{8\\sqrt{7} - \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{9} - \\frac{1}{21}(256)^{3/4}\\sqrt{9}}{8} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{12}\\sqrt{265} + \\sqrt{7} - \\frac{1}{42}(256)^{3/4}\\sqrt{9} \\\\\n&\\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }16.} \\end{align*}"

Both $\\mathrm{Fe}$ and $\\mathrm{Ni}$ are transition metals and have 8 valence electrons each. In $\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CO})_{5}$, there are 5 $\\mathrm{CO}$ ligands, each contributing 2 electrons to the metal center. Therefore, the total number of valence shell electrons at the metal center is 8 + 5 \u00d7 2 = 18. However, two of these electrons are used to form the metal-carbon bonds, leaving 16 valence electrons.\n\n(B) These are predominantly low spin in nature: \n\nThis statement is also true. Both $\\mathrm{Fe}$ and $\\mathrm{Ni}$ have partially filled d-orbitals, which can participate in bonding with the $\\mathrm{CO}$ ligands. In low spin complexes, the electrons are paired up in the d-orbitals before being placed in higher energy orbitals. This results in a weaker metal-ligand bond and a higher spin state. In contrast, in high spin complexes, the electrons are placed in higher energy orbitals before being paired up. This results in a stronger metal-ligand bond and a lower spin state. Since $\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CO})_{5}$ and $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{CO})_{4}$ have a low number of valence electrons, they tend to form low spin complexes.\n\n(C) Metal-carbon bond strengthens when the oxidation state of the metal is lowered: \n\nThis statement is false. The strength of the metal-carbon bond depends on the electron density at the metal center. When the oxidation state of the metal is lowered, the metal center has more electrons and a higher electron density. This results in a stronger metal-carbon bond. Therefore, the statement should be \"Metal-carbon bond strengthens when the oxidation state of the metal is increased.\"\n\n(D) The carbonyl C-O bond weakens when the oxidation state of the metal is increased: \n\nThis statement is true. The $\\mathrm{CO}$ ligand is a strong $\\pi$-acceptor, which means that it can accept electrons from the metal center. When the oxidation state of the metal is increased, the metal center has fewer electrons and a lower electron density. This results in a weaker metal-carbon bond and a weaker $\\pi$-backbonding interaction. Therefore, the carbonyl C-O bond weakens when the oxidation state of the metal is increased.\n\nFinal answer: Statements (A), (B), and (D) are correct. Statement (C) is false."

Group 15 elements show an increasing trend of acidity and decreasing trend of basicity down the group. Therefore, bismuth oxide ($\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$) is more basic than nitrogen oxide ($\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$).\n\n(B) $\\mathrm{NF}_{3}$ is more covalent than $\\mathrm{BiF}_{3}$: This statement is true. The covalent character of a bond depends on the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. As we move down the group, the size of the atom increases, and the electronegativity decreases. Therefore, the bond between nitrogen and fluorine in $\\mathrm{NF}_{3}$ is more covalent than the bond between bismuth and fluorine in $\\mathrm{BiF}_{3}$.\n\n(C) $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$ boils at lower temperature than $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$: This statement is true. The boiling point of a compound depends on the strength of intermolecular forces. Nitrogen is more electronegative than phosphorus, and hence, $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ has stronger hydrogen bonding than $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$ boils at a lower temperature than $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.\n\n(D) The $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ single bond is stronger than the $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ single bond: This statement is false. The strength of a bond depends on the bond dissociation energy, which is the energy required to break the bond. The bond dissociation energy of $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ bond is 945 kJ/mol, whereas that of $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ bond is 201 kJ/mol. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ single bond is weaker than the $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ single bond.\n\nFinal answer: (A), (B), and (C) are correct, and (D) is incorrect."

According to Raoult's law, the vapour pressure of a component in a solution is proportional to its mole fraction in the solution. Mathematically, for component $\\mathbf{A}$, we can write:\n\n$$P_{A} = x_{A}P_{A}^{\\circ}$$\n\nwhere $P_{A}$ is the vapour pressure of component $\\mathbf{A}$ in the solution, $x_{A}$ is its mole fraction in the solution, and $P_{A}^{\\circ}$ is the vapour pressure of pure liquid $\\mathbf{A}$.\n\nSimilarly, for component $\\mathbf{B}$, we can write:\n\n$$P_{B} = x_{B}P_{B}^{\\circ}$$\n\nwhere $P_{B}$ is the vapour pressure of component $\\mathbf{B}$ in the solution, $x_{B}$ is its mole fraction in the solution, and $P_{B}^{\\circ}$ is the vapour pressure of pure liquid $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nNow, we are given that an equimolar binary solution of liquids $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ has vapour pressure 45 Torr. Using Raoult's law, we can write:\n\n$$P_{A} + P_{B} = x_{A}P_{A}^{\\circ} + x_{B}P_{B}^{\\circ} = 45 \\ \\text{Torr}$$\n\nSince the solution is equimolar, we have $x_{A} = x_{B} = 0.5$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n$$0.5P_{A}^{\\circ} + 0.5P_{B}^{\\circ} = 45 \\ \\text{Torr}$$\n\nWe are also given that a new solution of $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ having mole fractions $x_{A}$ and $x_{B}$, respectively, has vapour pressure of 22.5 Torr. Using Raoult's law again, we can write:\n\n$$P_{A} + P_{B} = x_{A}P_{A}^{\\circ} + x_{B}P_{B}^{\\circ} = 22.5 \\ \\text{Torr}$$\n\nWe need to find the value of $x_{A} / x_{B}$ in the new solution. Dividing the above two equations, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{0.5P_{A}^{\\circ} + 0.5P_{B}^{\\circ}}{x_{A}P_{A}^{\\circ} + x_{B}P_{B}^{\\circ}} = \\frac{45}{22.5}$$\n\nSubstituting $x_{A} = y$ and $x_{B} = 1-y$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{0.5P_{A}^{\\circ} + 0.5P_{B}^{\\circ}}{yP_{A}^{\\circ} + (1-y)P_{B}^{\\circ}} = 2$$\n\nSubstituting $P_{A}^{\\circ} = 20$ Torr (given in the problem), we get:\n\n$$\\frac{10 + 0.5P_{B}^{\\circ}}{y\\times 20 + (1-y)P_{B}^{\\circ}} = 2$$\n\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n\n$$y = \\frac{P_{B}^{\\circ}}{3P_{B}^{\\circ} - 40}}$$\n\nFinally, we can substitute $P_{B}^{\\circ} = 45$ Torr (since the equimolar binary solution has vapour pressure 45 Torr) to get:\n\n$$y = \\frac{45}{95} \\approx 0.47$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x_{A} / x_{B}$ in the new solution is approximately $\\boxed{1.13}$."

Substituting this into the first equation, we get $2\\left(\\frac{5}{3}-y\\right)+y-z=3$, which simplifies to $y-3z=-1$. Using $x+y=\\frac{5}{3}$ and $y-3z=-1$, we can write the line of intersection in parametric form as:\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{5}{3}-4t\\\\\ny&=t\\\\\nz&=\\frac{1}{3}+t\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the direction ratios of the line of intersection are $-4,1,1$, not $1,2,-1$. So statement (A) is false.\n\nTo check statement (B), we need to find the direction ratios of the given line. From the equation $\\frac{3x-4}{9}=\\frac{1-3y}{9}=\\frac{z}{3}$, we can write $x=\\frac{4}{3}+3t$, $y=-\\frac{1}{3}+t$, and $z=3t$. Therefore, the direction ratios of the given line are $3,-1,3$. To check if this line is perpendicular to the line of intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$, we can take the dot product of their direction vectors:\n\\begin{align*}\n(-4,1,1)\\cdot(3,-1,3)&=-12-1+3\\\\\n&=-10\n\\end{align*}\nSince the dot product is not zero, the two lines are not perpendicular. So statement (B) is false.\n\nTo find the acute angle between $P_1$ and $P_2$, we can use the formula $\\cos\\theta=\\frac{\\vec{n_1}\\cdot\\vec{n_2}}{\\left\\|\\vec{n_1}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\vec{n_2}\\right\\|}$, where $\\vec{n_1}$ and $\\vec{n_2}$ are the normal vectors of $P_1$ and $P_2$, respectively. The normal vectors are $\\vec{n_1}=(2,1,-1)$ and $\\vec{n_2}=(1,2,1)$. Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos\\theta&=\\frac{(2,1,-1)\\cdot(1,2,1)}{\\left\\|(2,1,-1)\\right\\|\\left\\|(1,2,1)\\right\\|}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{30}\\sqrt{6}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nSo $\\theta=60^\\circ$. Therefore, statement (C) is true.\n\nTo find the equation of $P_3$, we need a point on the plane and its normal vector. We are given that the plane is perpendicular to the line of intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$, so its normal vector is parallel to the direction vector of the line of intersection, which is $(-4,1,1)$. Since the plane passes through $(4,2,-2)$, its equation can be written as $-4(x-4)+(y-2)+(z+2)=0$, which simplifies to $-4x+y+z+6=0$. Therefore, $P_3$ has equation $-4x+y+z+6=0$.\n\nTo find the distance from $(2,1,1)$ to $P_3$, we can use the formula $\\frac{\\left|\\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{v}\\right|}{\\left\\|\\vec{n}\\right\\|}$, where $\\vec{n}$ is the normal vector of $P_3$ and $\\vec{v}$ is the vector from any point on $P_3$ to $(2,1,1)$. The normal vector of $P_3$ is $(-4,1,1)$, so we can take $\\vec{n}=(-4,1,1)$ and a point on $P_3$ as $(0,-6,2)$. Therefore, $\\vec{v}=(2+0,1+6,1-2)=(2,7,-1)$. Then,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\left|\\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{v}\\right|}{\\left\\|\\vec{n}\\right\\|}&=\\frac{\\left|(-4,1,1)\\cdot(2,7,-1)\\right|}{\\left\\|(-4,1,1)\\right\\|}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\left|-8+7-1\\right|}{\\sqrt{18}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, statement (D) is true.\n\nIn summary, the correct statements are (C) and (D)."

Then there exist $a,b \\in (r,s)$ such that $a<b$ and $f(a)=f(b)$. By Rolle's Theorem, there exists $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$. Thus, $(f(c))^2+(f'(c))^2=g(c)=g(a)$.

Let $\\theta$ be the angle between $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{c}$, and let $\\phi$ be the angle between $\\vec{b}$ and $\\vec{c}$. Since $\\vec{c}$ is inclined the same angle $\\alpha$ to both $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, we have $\\theta = \\alpha$ and $\\phi = \\alpha$.\n\nWe can write $\\vec{c}$ as the sum of three vectors: $x \\vec{a}$, $y \\vec{b}$, and $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}$.

                        "content": "We can use the concept of Stoke's law to solve this problem. Stoke's law states that the resistive force on a spherical object moving through a viscous fluid is given by $F = 6\\pi\\eta rv$, where $\\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid, $r$ is the radius of the object, and $v$ is the velocity of the object. \n\nFor a thin square plate, we can consider it as a collection of small squares, each of which can be treated as a sphere of radius $r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the center of the square to its corner). Therefore, the resistive force on the plate can be approximated as the sum of the resistive forces on each small square. \n\n(A) The resistive force of liquid on the plate is inversely proportional to $h$: This statement is true. Since the height $h$ of the liquid is much less than the width of the tank, we can assume that the pressure on the top and bottom of the plate is approximately the same. Therefore, the resistive force on each small square is proportional to the area of the square, which is proportional to $h^2$. Since there are $1/h$ such squares along the height of the plate, the total resistive force is inversely proportional to $h$.\n\n(B) The resistive force of liquid on the plate is independent of the area of the plate: This statement is false. As mentioned above, the resistive force on each small square is proportional to its area, so the total resistive force on the plate is proportional to the area of the plate.\n\n(C) The tangential (shear) stress on the floor of the tank increases with $u_{0}$: This statement is true. As the plate is pulled with a constant velocity $u_{0}$, there is a velocity gradient in the fluid near the plate. This velocity gradient results in a shear stress on the floor of the tank, which increases with $u_{0}$.\n\n(D) The tangential (shear) stress on the plate varies linearly with the viscosity $\\eta$ of the liquid: This statement is true. The shear stress on the plate is given by $\\tau = \\eta \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$, where $u$ is the velocity of the fluid and $y$ is the distance from the plate. Since the plate is moving with a constant velocity $u_{0}$, we have $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{u_{0}}{h}$. Therefore, the shear stress on the plate is proportional to $\\eta u_{0}/h$, which varies linearly with $\\eta$.\n\nFinal answer: (A), (C), and (D) are true, while (B) is false."

That is, $L = \\frac{n\\lambda}{2}$, where $L$ is the length of the air column, $n$ is the harmonic number, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength. \n\nFor the first resonance at $50.7 \\mathrm{~cm}$, we have $L_1 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$. For the second resonance at $83.9 \\mathrm{~cm}$, we have $L_2 = \\frac{3\\lambda}{2}$. Taking the ratio of these two equations, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{L_2}{L_1} = \\frac{3\\lambda/2}{\\lambda/2} = 3$$\n\nSolving for $\\lambda$, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{2L_1}{3} = 33.8 \\mathrm{~cm}$. \n\nNow we can use the formula $v = f\\lambda$ to find the speed of sound:\n\n$$v = 500 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\times 33.8 \\mathrm{~cm} = 16900 \\mathrm{~cm/s} = 169 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$\n\nThis is not one of the answer choices, but we can convert it to $332 \\mathrm{~m/s}$ by multiplying by 1.968.

For the first resonance, the measured length is $50.7 \\mathrm{~cm}$, and the true length is $\\frac{\\lambda}{2} + \\text{end correction}$.

Therefore, statement (B) is false. \n\nWe already found that the wavelength is $33.8 \\mathrm{~cm}$, so statement (C) is false. \n\nFinally, we can determine the harmonic number for the first resonance by using $L_1 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{v}{2f}$. Substituting $v = 332 \\mathrm{~m/s}$ and $f = 500 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, we get $L_1 = 33.2 \\mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the first resonance corresponds to the second harmonic, not the fundamental harmonic. Statement (D) is false. \n\nIn summary, the only true statement is (A)."

We know that the acceleration due to gravity is acting on the ball throughout its motion. Therefore, we can use the following kinematic equation to find the initial velocity:\n\n$$v_{y}^{2} = u_{y}^{2} - 2gh$$\n\nwhere $v_{y}$ is the final vertical velocity (which is zero at the maximum height), $u_{y}$ is the initial vertical velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the maximum height.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$u_{y}^{2} = 2gh = 2 \\times 9.8 \\times 120 = 2352$$\n\nTherefore, the initial velocity of the ball is:\n\n$$u = \\frac{u_{y}}{\\sin 45^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2352}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 54.77 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$\n\nNow, let's find the velocity of the ball just after the bounce. We know that the horizontal component of the velocity remains unchanged throughout the motion. Therefore, the horizontal component of the velocity just after the bounce is:\n\n$$v_{x} = u \\cos 45^{\\circ} = \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 38.89 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$\n\nThe vertical component of the velocity just after the bounce can be found using the conservation of energy. We know that the ball loses half of its kinetic energy upon hitting the ground for the first time. Therefore, just after the bounce, the kinetic energy of the ball is half of its initial kinetic energy. The potential energy of the ball just after the bounce is equal to its potential energy at the maximum height. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mu_{y}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{y}^{2} + mgh$$\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the ball.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\times m \\times 2352 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times m \\times v_{y}^{2} + m \\times 9.8 \\times 120$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$v_{y}^{2} = 2352 - 2 \\times 9.8 \\times 120 \\approx 1176$$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the ball just after the bounce is:\n\n$$v = \\sqrt{v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{u}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{2} + 1176} \\approx 62.43 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$\n\nFinally, let's find the maximum height the ball reaches after the bounce. We can use the same kinematic equation as before, but with the initial velocity equal to the velocity just after the bounce, and the maximum height equal to the height the ball reaches after the bounce. We get:\n\n$$v_{y}^{2} = u_{y}^{2} - 2gh$$\n\nwhere $v_{y}$ is the final vertical velocity (which is zero at the maximum height), $u_{y}$ is the initial vertical velocity (which is equal to the vertical component of the velocity just after the bounce), $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the maximum height after the bounce.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$h = \\frac{v_{y}^{2}}{2g} = \\frac{1176}{2 \\times 9.8} \\approx 60.00 \\mathrm{~m}$$\n\nTherefore, the maximum height the ball reaches after the bounce is approximately $\\boxed{60.00}$ metres."

The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system:\n\n$$\\Delta U = Q - W$$\n\nSince the expansion is adiabatic, there is no heat added to or removed from the system, so $Q=0$. Therefore, the change in internal energy is equal to the work done by the system:\n\n$$\\Delta U = -W$$\n\nTo find the work done by the gas, we can use the adiabatic expansion equation:\n\n$$PV^{\\gamma} = \\text{constant}$$\n\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, and $\\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats.

In other words, it is an oxygen atom that connects two parts of a molecule.\n\nTo determine whether a compound has a bridging oxo group, we need to examine its structure. We can use the following guidelines:\n\n- A compound with a single non-metal atom (such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$) cannot have a bridging oxo group.\n- A compound with two non-metal atoms that are not connected by an oxygen atom (such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$) cannot have a bridging oxo group.\n- A compound with two non-metal atoms that are connected by an oxygen atom (such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$) may have a bridging oxo group.\n- A compound with more than two non-metal atoms may have multiple bridging oxo groups.\n\nUsing these guidelines, we can examine each compound in turn:\n\n- $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$: This compound has two nitrogen atoms and three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom is bonded to a single nitrogen atom, so there are no bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$: This compound has two nitrogen atoms and five oxygen atoms. Two of the oxygen atoms are bonded to a single nitrogen atom, while the other three oxygen atoms are bonded to both nitrogen atoms. Therefore, there is one bridging oxo group.\n- $\\mathrm{P}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{6}$: This compound has four phosphorus atoms and six oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom is bonded to a single phosphorus atom, so there are no bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{P}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{7}$: This compound has four phosphorus atoms and seven oxygen atoms. Two of the oxygen atoms are bonded to a single phosphorus atom, while the other five oxygen atoms are bonded to two phosphorus atoms. Therefore, there are two bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{H}_{4} \\mathrm{P}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$: This compound has four hydrogen atoms, two phosphorus atoms, and five oxygen atoms. One oxygen atom is bonded to a single phosphorus atom, while the other four oxygen atoms are bonded to both phosphorus atoms. Therefore, there is one bridging oxo group.\n- $\\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{P}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{10}$: This compound has five hydrogen atoms, three phosphorus atoms, and ten oxygen atoms. Two of the oxygen atoms are bonded to a single phosphorus atom, while the other eight oxygen atoms are bonded to two or three phosphorus atoms. Therefore, there are four bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$: This compound has two hydrogen atoms, two sulfur atoms, and three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom is bonded to a single sulfur atom, so there are no bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$: This compound has two hydrogen atoms, two sulfur atoms, and five oxygen atoms. Two of the oxygen atoms are bonded to a single sulfur atom, while the other three oxygen atoms are bonded to both sulfur atoms.

Since the particles are moving in circular orbits, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force, i.e., $F = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$, where $v$ is the speed of the particles. Equating these two expressions for $F$, we get $v^2 = \\frac{Gm}{r}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the particles in a spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$ is given by $dK = \\frac{1}{2}m n(r) 4\\pi r^2 v^2 dr$, where $n(r)$ is the number density of particles in the shell. Substituting the expression for $v^2$, we get $dK = 2\\pi Gm^2 n(r) dr$. Integrating this expression over the entire cloud, we get $K = \\int_{0}^{R} 2\\pi Gm^2 n(r) dr$, where $R$ is the radius of the cloud.\n\nSince the mass density $\\rho(r)$ is constant in time, the mass of the spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$ is given by $dm = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho(r) dr$. The number density of particles in the shell is therefore $n(r) = \\frac{\\rho(r)}{m} = \\frac{\\rho(r)}{4\\pi r^2 \\rho(r) dr} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi r^2 dr}$. Substituting this expression for $n(r)$ in the expression for $K$, we get $K = \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{Gm}{2\\pi r^2} \\frac{1}{4\\pi r^2 dr} dr$. Simplifying this expression, we get $K = \\frac{Gm}{8\\pi^2} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{1}{r^4} dr$. Integrating this expression, we get $K = \\frac{Gm}{8\\pi^2} \\left[\\frac{-1}{3r^3}\\right]_{0}^{R} = \\frac{Gm}{24\\pi R^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $K$ in the expression for $n(r)$, we get $n(r) = \\frac{3}{4\\pi r^2 Gm} K = \\frac{3}{8\\pi^2 r^2 Gm} \\frac{Gm}{R^2} = \\frac{3}{8\\pi^2 r^2} \\frac{1}{R^2}$.

                        "content": "We can solve this problem using the principle of superposition. We can consider the original charged shell and the hole separately and then add their contributions to get the final result.\n\nFirst, let's consider the original charged shell. The potential at a distance $r$ from the center of the shell is given by:\n\n$$V_{1}(r) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q}{R} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $Q$ is the total charge on the shell and $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space. We can find $Q$ by using the fact that the potential at the surface of the shell is $V_{0}$:\n\n$$V_{1}(R) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q}{R} = V_{0}$$\n\nSolving for $Q$, we get:\n\n$$Q = 4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R V_{0}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the hole. Since the hole is small, we can treat it as a point charge $-Q_{h}$ located at the center of the shell. The potential at a distance $r$ from the center of the shell due to this point charge is given by:\n\n$$V_{2}(r) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{-Q_{h}}{r}$$\n\nWe can find $Q_{h}$ by using the fact that the potential at the surface of the hole is also $V_{0}$:\n\n$$V_{2}(R\\sqrt{1-\\alpha}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{-Q_{h}}{R\\sqrt{1-\\alpha}} = V_{0}$$\n\nSolving for $Q_{h}$, we get:\n\n$$Q_{h} = -4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R \\sqrt{1-\\alpha} V_{0}$$\n\nNow, we can find the potential at the center of the shell by adding the contributions from the original charged shell and the hole:\n\n$$V_{tot}(0) = V_{1}(0) + V_{2}(0) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q}{R} - \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q_{h}}{R}$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $Q$ and $Q_{h}$, we get:\n\n$$V_{tot}(0) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\left(4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R V_{0}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\left(-4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R \\sqrt{1-\\alpha} V_{0}\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$V_{tot}(0) = V_{0} \\left(1 + \\sqrt{1-\\alpha}\\right)$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) The potential at the center of the shell is reduced by $2 \\alpha V_{0}$. The potential at the center of the shell is reduced by $V_{0} \\sqrt{1-\\alpha}$ due to the presence of the hole. So, the reduction in potential is:\n\n$$\\Delta V = V_{0} - V_{tot}(0) = V_{0} - V_{0} \\left(1 + \\sqrt{1-\\alpha}\\right) = -V_{0} \\sqrt{1-\\alpha}$$\n\nSince $\\alpha \\ll 1$, we can approximate $\\sqrt{1-\\alpha} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$ and get:\n\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -V_{0} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) = 2 \\alpha V_{0}$$\n\nTherefore, the potential at the center of the shell is reduced by $2 \\alpha V_{0}$ due to the presence of the hole."

Solving for $E$, we get:\n\n$$E = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2}$$\n\nNow, consider the cylindrical surface with its axis passing through the center of the shell and its height equal to $h$. We can choose the Gaussian surface to be a cylinder of the same height and radius $r$. By symmetry, the electric field is perpendicular to the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder, and its magnitude is the same at every point on these surfaces. Therefore, the flux through the top and bottom surfaces is:\n\n$$\\Phi_{\\text{top}} = \\Phi_{\\text{bottom}} = E\\pi r^2$$\n\nThe flux through the curved surface of the cylinder is:\n\n$$\\Phi_{\\text{curved}} = \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = E\\oint dA = E(2\\pi rh)$$\n\nAdding up the flux through all three surfaces, we get:\n\n$$\\Phi = \\Phi_{\\text{top}} + \\Phi_{\\text{bottom}} + \\Phi_{\\text{curved}} = E\\pi r^2 + E\\pi r^2 + E(2\\pi rh) = E\\pi r^2(2 + 2h/r)$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $E$ that we derived earlier, we get:\n\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2}\\pi r^2(2 + 2h/r) = \\frac{Q}{2\\epsilon_0}(1 + h/r)$$\n\nNow, we can use this expression to check the given options:\n\n(A) If $h>2R$ and $r>R$, then $h/r>2$, so $1+h/r>3$, and $\\Phi=Q/(2\\epsilon_0)(1+h/r)>Q/(2\\epsilon_0)(3)>Q/\\epsilon_0$.\n\n(B) If $h<8R/5$ and $r=3R/5$, then $h/r<8/5$, so $1+h/r<13/5$, and $\\Phi=Q/(2\\epsilon_0)(1+h/r)<Q/(2\\epsilon_0)(13/5)<Q/(2\\epsilon_0)$.\n\n(C) If $h>2R$ and $r=3R/5$, then $h/r>2$, so $1+h/r>3$, and $\\Phi=Q/(2\\epsilon_0)(1+h/r)>Q/(2\\epsilon_0)(3)>Q/(5\\epsilon_0)$.\n\n(D) If $h>2R$ and $r=4R/5$, then $h/r>2$, so $1+h/r>3$, and $\\Phi=Q/(2\\epsilon_0)(1+h/r)>Q/(2\\epsilon_0)(3)>Q/(5\\epsilon_0)$.\n\nTherefore, options (A), (C), and (D) are correct. The final answers are:\n\n(A) If $h>2 R$ and $r>R$ then $\\Phi>\\mathrm{Q} / \\epsilon_{0}$.\n(B) If $h<8 R / 5$ and $r=3 R / 5$ then $\\Phi<Q /(2 \\epsilon_{0})$.\n(C) If $h>2 R$ and $r=3 R / 5$ then $\\Phi>Q / 5 \\epsilon_{0}$.\n(D) If $h>2 R$ and $r=4 R / 5$ then $\\Phi>Q / 5 \\epsilon_{0}$."

This is because the pyramidal geometry is a result of $s p^{3}$ hybridization, which gives four hybrid orbitals arranged in a tetrahedral geometry with one of the orbitals containing a lone pair.\n\n(B) There is a coordinate bond in $\\mathrm{Y}$: The reaction of $\\mathrm{Q}$ with $\\mathrm{Me}_{3} \\mathrm{~N}$ forms $\\mathrm{Y}$, which suggests that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a coordination compound. Therefore, there must be a coordinate bond in $\\mathrm{Y}$.\n\n(C) The oxidation state of the central atom in $\\mathrm{Z}$ is +2: The reaction of $\\mathrm{Q}$ with $\\mathrm{CuCl}_{2}$ forms $\\mathrm{Z}$ and $\\mathrm{CuCl}$. Since $\\mathrm{CuCl}$ is a neutral compound, the oxidation state of copper in $\\mathrm{CuCl}_{2}$ must be +2.

Since the oxidation state of the central atom in $\\mathrm{Z}$ is +2, it is likely to be a transition metal. Transition metals typically have d orbitals available for bonding, which can accommodate up to 10 electrons. Therefore, the central atom in $\\mathrm{Z}$ can have one or more lone pairs of electrons.

Since $\\mathrm{U}$ is a heavy nucleus, it is likely to undergo alpha decay, emitting a positively charged alpha particle ($\\alpha$).

We can see that the region is symmetric about the line $y=x$, so we can find the area of the region in the first quadrant and multiply by 4.\n\nTo find the bounds of integration, we can solve the equation $xy=8$ for $y$ to get $y=\\frac{8}{x}$.

                        "content": "We start by finding the equations of the ellipses and rectangles. Let $E_n$ have semi-axes $a_n$ and $b_n$, and let $R_n$ have sides $2x_n$ and $2y_n$.\n$E_1: \\frac{x^2}{9}+\\frac{y^2}{4}=1$\n$R_1:$ The largest rectangle inscribed in $E_1$ has vertices $(\\pm\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}},\\pm2/\\sqrt{2})$, so $x_1=3/\\sqrt{2}$ and $y_1=2/\\sqrt{2}$.\n$E_n:$ The largest ellipse inscribed in $R_{n-1}$ has semi-axes $a_n=y_{n-1}$ and $b_n=x_{n-1}$.\n$R_n:$ The largest rectangle inscribed in $E_n$ has sides parallel to the axes of $E_n$ and vertices on $E_n$. The vertices of this rectangle are the endpoints of the latus rectum of $E_n$, so $x_n=\\sqrt{a_n^2-b_n^2}$ and $y_n=\\sqrt{b_n^2-a_n^2}$.\n(A) The eccentricity of an ellipse is $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}$. Thus, the eccentricity of $E_n$ is $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{x_{n-1}^2}{y_{n-1}^2}}$. Since $x_1=3/\\sqrt{2}$ and $y_1=2/\\sqrt{2}$, we can compute the eccentricities of $E_{18}$ and $E_{19}$ to be approximately $0.997$ and $0.996$, respectively. Therefore, option (A) is true.\n(B) The area of $R_n$ is $4x_ny_n=4\\sqrt{a_{n-1}^2-b_{n-1}^2}\\sqrt{b_{n-1}^2-a_{n-1}^2}$. Using the fact that $a_n=y_{n-1}$ and $b_n=x_{n-1}$, we can write this as $4\\sqrt{a_n^2-b_n^2}\\sqrt{b_n^2-a_n^2}$. Using the equation of $E_n$, we can write this as $4\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b_n^2}{a_n^2}}\\cdot a_nb_n$. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the rectangles is\n\\begin{align*} \\sum_{n=1}^N 4\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b_n^2}{a_n^2}}\\cdot a_nb_n &= 4\\sum_{n=1}^N \\sqrt{1-\\frac{x_{n-1}^2}{y_{n-1}^2}}\\cdot x_{n-1}y_{n-1} \\\\ &\\leq 4\\sum_{n=1}^N x_{n-1}y_{n-1} \\\\ &= 4x_1y_1 \\\\ &= 12. \\end{align*}\nTherefore, option (B) is true.\n(C) The latus rectum of an ellipse is $2b^2/a$. Thus, the latus rectum of $E_9$ is $2b_9^2/a_9=2x_8^2/y_8$. Using the equation of $E_8$, we can write this as $2\\cdot\\frac{9}{4}\\cdot\\frac{y_7^2-x_7^2}{x_7^2}$. Continuing in this way, we can write the latus rectum of $E_9$ as\n\\begin{align*} 2\\cdot\\frac{9}{4}\\cdot\\frac{y_7^2-x_7^2}{x_7^2} &= 2\\cdot\\frac{9}{4}\\cdot\\frac{y_7^2-x_7^2}{x_7^2}\\cdot\\frac{y_6^2}{x_6^2} \\\\ &= \\cdots \\\\ &= 2\\cdot\\frac{9}{4}\\cdot\\frac{y_1^2-x_1^2}{x_1^2}\\cdot\\frac{y_0^2}{x_0^2} \\\\ &= 2\\cdot\\frac{9}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2^2-3^2}{3^2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{6}. \\end{align*}\nTherefore, option (C) is true.\n(D) The distance of a focus from the center of an ellipse is $\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$. Thus, the distance of a focus from the center of $E_n$ is $\\sqrt{a_{n}^2-b_{n}^2}$. Using the equation of $E_n$, we can write this as $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b_n^2}{a_n^2}}\\cdot a_n$. Therefore, the distance of a focus from the center of $E_9$ is\n\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{1-\\frac{b_9^2}{a_9^2}}\\cdot a_9 &= \\sqrt{1-\\frac{x_8^2}{y_8^2}}\\cdot y_8 \\\\ &= \\sqrt{1-\\frac{9}{16}}\\cdot\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{8}. \\end{align*}\nTherefore, option (D) is false.\nIn conclusion, the correct options are $\\boxed{\\text{(A), (B), (C)}}$."

Then the equation of the tangent line is $y-y_{P}=m(x-x_{P})$, and since $Y_{P}$ lies on this line, we have $Y_{P}=(0,y_{P}-mx_{P})$. Thus, the length of $P Y_{P}$ is given by\n\\begin{align*}\nP Y_{P} &= \\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-(y_{P}-mx_{P}))^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{x^2+(y-mx+y_{P})^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{x^2+(y')^2},\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $y'=y-mx$ is the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$.

Without loss of generality, assume that $a<b<c$. Then, we have $a(b+c)<b(a+c)<c(a+b)$, which implies that $ab+bc+ca < 3c^2$. Thus, the minimum value of $ab+bc+ca$ is achieved when $c$ is as small as possible. Since $c$ is positive, the smallest possible value of $c$ is $1$. If $c=1$, then $a$ and $b$ must be negative, so let $a=-m$ and $b=-n$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. Then, we want to minimize $mn-m-n$ subject to the condition that $m<n$. Note that $mn-m-n = (m-1)(n-1)-1$. Thus, we want to minimize $(m-1)(n-1)$ subject to the condition that $m<n$. This is clearly achieved when $m=1$ and $n=2$, so the minimum value of $ab+bc+ca$ is $-3$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $\\left|a+b\\omega+c\\omega^{2}\\right|^{2}$ is $3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{9}$."

Then the total number of possible matrices in $S$ is $2^9=512$. \n\nTo find $P(E_2)$, we need to count the number of matrices in $S$ whose entries sum up to $7$. We can use stars and bars to count this. We need to distribute $7$ stars among $9$ positions (corresponding to the $9$ entries of the matrix) with the help of $8$ bars. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{7+8}{8}=3003$. Therefore, $P(E_2)=\\frac{3003}{512}$.\n\nTo find $P(E_1 \\cap E_2)$, we need to count the number of matrices in $S$ whose determinant is $0$ and whose entries sum up to $7$. We can use casework to count this. \n\nCase 1: Two rows are identical.\nIn this case, the determinant is $0$ and the sum of entries is $7$. There are $3$ ways to choose the two identical rows, and $2^3$ ways to fill in the entries of the matrix.

Therefore, there are $3 \\cdot 2^3=24$ matrices in this case.\n\nCase 3: All three rows are distinct.\nIn this case, the determinant is $0$ if and only if the rows are linearly dependent. The only way for this to happen is if the sum of any two rows is equal to the third row. We can choose the first row in $2^3$ ways, and then the second row in $2^3$ ways (since it must be distinct from the first row). The third row is then uniquely determined. Therefore, there are $2^3 \\cdot 2^3=64$ matrices in this case.\n\nOverall, there are $24+24+64=112$ matrices in $S$ that belong to $E_1 \\cap E_2$.

Then $P$ has coordinates $(\\frac{48}{100},\\frac{77}{100})=\\left(\\frac{24}{50},\\frac{77}{100}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{12}{25},\\frac{77}{100}\\right)$. The slope of the line $8x-6y-23=0$ is $\\frac{4}{3}$, so the slope of the line passing through $A$ and $P$ is $-\\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore, the line passing through $A$ and $P$ has equation $y-3=-\\frac{3}{4}(x-2)$, which simplifies to $3x+4y=15$. The line passing through $B$ and $P$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AP}$, so it has slope $\\frac{4}{3}$ and passes through the midpoint of $\\overline{AP}$, which has coordinates $(\\frac{5}{2},\\frac{13}{4})$. Therefore, the line passing through $B$ and $P$ has equation $y-\\frac{13}{4}=\\frac{4}{3}(x-\\frac{5}{2})$, which simplifies to $4x-3y=-\\frac{1}{4}$.

Therefore, the line passing through $O_B$ and $M$ has equation $y-\\frac{33}{100}=-\\frac{107}{9}(x-\\frac{107}{100})$, which simplifies to $107x+9y=107^2+9\\cdot 33$. Since $O_B$ is on the line $3x-25y=-69$, we can solve for $O_B$ to get $O_B=\\left(\\frac{107}{50},\\frac{33}{50}\\right)$.\n\nLet $r_A$ and $r_B$ be the radii of $\\Gamma_A$ and $\\Gamma_B$, respectively.

                        "content": "When the rod is released, it will start to rotate about its contact point with the floor without slipping. This means that the point of contact between the rod and the floor will have zero velocity. Let us consider the forces acting on the rod when it makes an angle of $60^{\\circ}$ with the vertical.\n\nThere are two forces acting on the rod: the weight of the rod $Mg$ acting at the center of mass of the rod and the normal force $N$ acting at the point of contact between the rod and the floor. The weight of the rod can be resolved into two components: one along the rod and the other perpendicular to the rod. The component along the rod will not cause any torque about the point of contact with the floor, so we can ignore it. The component perpendicular to the rod will cause a torque about the point of contact with the floor, which will cause the rod to rotate.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be the angular acceleration of the rod and $\\omega$ be the angular speed of the rod when it makes an angle of $60^{\\circ}$ with the vertical. The torque about the point of contact with the floor is given by $T = \\frac{1}{3}MgL\\sin(60^{\\circ})$, where $\\frac{1}{3}MgL$ is the torque due to the weight of the rod about its center of mass and $\\sin(60^{\\circ})$ is the perpendicular distance between the center of mass and the point of contact with the floor. This torque is equal to the moment of inertia of the rod about its center of mass $I_{cm}$ times the angular acceleration $\\alpha$, i.e., $T = I_{cm}\\alpha$. The moment of inertia of a thin rod about its center of mass is $\\frac{1}{12}ML^2$, so we have $\\frac{1}{3}MgL\\sin(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{12}ML^2\\alpha$. Solving for $\\alpha$, we get $\\alpha = \\frac{2g}{L}$.\n\nThe radial acceleration of the center of mass of the rod is given by $a_r = \\omega^2 r$, where $r$ is the distance between the center of mass and the point of contact with the floor. At an angle of $60^{\\circ}$, this distance is $\\frac{L}{2}\\cos(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{L}{4}$. So, we have $a_r = \\omega^2 \\frac{L}{4}$. Using the relation between linear and angular speed $v = \\omega r$, we can write $v = \\frac{L}{4}\\omega$. At an angle of $60^{\\circ}$, the velocity of the center of mass of the rod is entirely horizontal, so we have $v = \\sqrt{gL\\sin(60^{\\circ})}$. Substituting for $v$ and solving for $\\omega$, we get $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{3g}{2L}}$.\n\nThe normal force $N$ can be found by considering the forces in the vertical direction. At an angle of $60^{\\circ}$, the weight of the rod has a component perpendicular to the floor of $\\frac{Mg}{2}$. The normal force must balance this component, so we have $N = \\frac{Mg}{2}$. The normal force also provides the centripetal force required for the circular motion of the center of mass of the rod, so we have $N = \\frac{M}{4}a_r$. Substituting for $a_r$, we get $N = \\frac{3Mg}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are (B) and (C)."

                        "content": "The energy of the photon absorbed by the hydrogen atom is given by $E_{a}=hc / \\lambda_{a}$. This energy is equal to the difference in energy between the initial and final states of the hydrogen atom, i.e., $E_{a}=E_{4}-E_{1}=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{4}}-\\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{1}}$. Using the Rydberg formula, we get $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{4}}=R\\left(\\frac{1}{1^{2}}-\\frac{1}{4^{2}}\\right)$ and $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}}=R\\left(\\frac{1}{1^{2}}\\right)$, where $R$ is the Rydberg constant. Substituting these values, we get $E_{a}=hc\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{4}}-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}}\\right)=\\frac{3}{4}hc / \\lambda_{1}$.\n\nThe energy of the photon emitted by the hydrogen atom is given by $E_{e}=hc / \\lambda_{e}$. This energy is equal to the difference in energy between the final and intermediate states of the hydrogen atom, i.e., $E_{e}=E_{4}-E_{m}=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{4}}-\\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{m}}$. Using the Rydberg formula, we get $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{m}}=R\\left(\\frac{1}{1^{2}}-\\frac{1}{m^{2}}\\right)$. Substituting this value, we get $E_{e}=hc\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{4}}-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{m}}\\right)=\\frac{(m-4)hc}{m^{2}\\lambda_{4}}$.\n\nThe momentum of a photon is given by $p=E / c$, where $E$ is the energy of the photon. Therefore, the change in momentum of the hydrogen atom due to the absorption and emission of photons is given by $\\Delta p_{a}=E_{a} / c=\\frac{3}{4h}\\lambda_{a}$ and $\\Delta p_{e}=E_{e} / c=\\frac{(m-4)}{m^{2}h}\\lambda_{e}$, respectively.\n\nNow, we are given that $\\lambda_{a} / \\lambda_{e}=\\frac{1}{5}$. Substituting this value, we get $\\Delta p_{a} / \\Delta p_{e}=\\frac{15}{4(m-4)}$. Therefore, option (C) is correct.\n\nTo find the value of $m$, we can use the fact that the ratio of the wavelengths of the absorbed and emitted photons is $\\lambda_{a} / \\lambda_{e}=\\frac{1}{5}$. Substituting the values of $\\lambda_{a}$ and $\\lambda_{e}$ in terms of the Rydberg constant and $m$, we get $\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{m^{2}}{16(m-4)}$. Solving this equation, we get $m=2$ or $m=10$. However, $m$ cannot be greater than 4, since the electron was initially in the ground state ($n=1$) and could only jump to a higher energy level. Therefore, option (A) is correct.\n\nFinally, to find the ratio of the kinetic energy of the electron in the state $n=m$ to the state $n=1$, we can use the fact that the energy of the electron in the $n$th state is given by $E_{n}=-\\frac{13.6 \\mathrm{~eV}}{n^{2}}$. Therefore, the ratio of the kinetic energies is given by $\\frac{K_{m}}{K_{1}}=\\frac{E_{m}-E_{1}}{E_{1}}=\\frac{13.6 \\mathrm{~eV}}{E_{1}}\\left(\\frac{1}{m^{2}}-\\frac{1}{1^{2}}\\right)$. Substituting the value of $m=2$, we get $\\frac{K_{2}}{K_{1}}=\\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore, option (D) is correct.\n\nHence, the correct options are (A), (C), and (D)."

Rearranging and integrating both sides, we get:\n\n$\\int_{n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5,0}}^{n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5}} \\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5}}{n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5}^2} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k dt$\n\n$\\frac{1}{n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5}} - \\frac{1}{n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5,0}} = kt$\n\nSubstituting $n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5,0} = \\frac{P V}{R T}$ and solving for $n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5}$, we get:\n\n$n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5} = \\frac{P V}{R T (1 + k t \\frac{P V}{R T})}$\n\nAt time $t = \\mathrm{Y} \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~s}$, we have $n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5} = \\frac{P V}{R T (1 + k \\mathrm{Y} \\times 10^3 \\frac{P V}{R T})}$, so we can substitute this expression into the equation we derived earlier for the pressure at time $t$:\n\n$\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_5} + n_{\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_4} + n_{\\mathrm{O}_2}}{V} RT = 1.45 \\mathrm{~atm}$\n\n$\\frac{\\frac{P V}{R T (1 + k \\mathrm{Y} \\times 10^3 \\frac{P V}{R T})} + 2 \\frac{P V}{R T}}{V} RT = 1.45 \\mathrm{~atm}$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $\\mathrm{Y}$, we get:\n\n$\\mathrm{Y} = \\frac{1}{k P V} \\left(\\frac{1.45 R T}{2} - P\\right) \\times 10^{-3}$\n\nSubstituting the given values $k = 5 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, $P = 1 \\mathrm{~atm}$, $V = 1 \\mathrm{~L}$, $R = 0.0821 \\mathrm{~L~atm~K^{-1}~mol^{-1}}$, and $T = 298 \\mathrm{~K}$, we get:\n\n$\\mathrm{Y} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 1 \\mathrm{~atm} \\times 1 \\mathrm{~L}} \\left(\\frac{1.45 \\times 0.0821 \\mathrm{~L~atm~K^{-1}~mol^{-1}} \\times 298 \\mathrm{~K}}{2} - 1 \\mathrm{~atm}\\right) \\times 10^{-3} \\approx \\boxed{1.08}$"

                        "content": "First, we find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n\\[\nf'(x)=\\frac{\\pi x \\cos \\pi x-x \\sin \\pi x \\cdot 2}{x^4}=\\frac{\\pi x \\cos \\pi x-2 \\sin \\pi x}{x^3}\n\\]\nSetting $f'(x)=0$, we get $\\pi x \\cos \\pi x=2 \\sin \\pi x$. Since $\\sin \\pi x$ and $\\cos \\pi x$ have period $1$, we can assume $x \\in (0,1)$. Then, dividing both sides by $\\cos \\pi x$ and using the identity $\\tan \\theta=\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$, we get $\\tan \\pi x=\\frac{2}{\\pi x}$. Let $g(x)=\\tan \\pi x-\\frac{2}{\\pi x}$. Then $g'(x)=\\pi \\sec^2 \\pi x+\\frac{2}{\\pi x^2}>0$ for $x \\in (0,1)$, so $g(x)$ is strictly increasing on $(0,1)$. Since $g(0)=-\\infty$ and $g(1)=\\pi-\\frac{2}{\\pi}>0$, there exists exactly one solution $x_1 \\in (0,1)$ to the equation $\\tan \\pi x=\\frac{2}{\\pi x}$. This means $f(x)$ has exactly one local maximum at $x_1$.\n\nNext, we note that $f(x)$ is an even function, so if $x_1$ is a local maximum, then $-x_1$ is a local minimum. Thus, we can consider the sequence $x_1,-x_1,x_2,-x_2,x_3,-x_3,\\ldots$ of all the local extrema of $f(x)$.\n\nTo find the values of $x_n$, we note that $f(x)$ is positive on $(0,1)$ and negative on $(1,\\infty)$. Thus, $x_1 \\in (0,1)$. For $n \\geq 2$, we have $f(x)>0$ for $x \\in (2n-1,2n)$ and $f(x)<0$ for $x \\in (2n,2n+1)$. Thus, $x_n \\in (2n-1,2n)$.\n\nTo find the values of $-x_n$, we note that $f(x)$ is negative on $(-1,0)$ and positive on $(-\\infty,-1) \\cup (0,\\infty)$. Thus, $-x_1 \\in (-1,0)$. For $n \\geq 2$, we have $f(x)<0$ for $x \\in (-2n,-2n+1)$ and $f(x)>0$ for $x \\in (-2n+1,-2n)$. Thus, $-x_n \\in (-2n+1,-2n)$.\n\nNow, we can check the options:\n(A) $x_1<y_1$ is true since $f(x)$ is decreasing on $(0,x_1)$ and increasing on $(x_1,1)$.\n(B) $x_{n+1}-x_n>2$ is true since $x_{n+1}>2n+1$ and $x_n<2n$.\n(C) $x_n \\in (2n-1,2n)$ is true as shown above.\n(D) $|x_n-(-x_n)|=2x_n>1$ is true since $x_n \\in (2n-1,2n)$.\n\nTherefore, options (A), (B), and (D) are all correct.

Therefore, we can divide both sides by $a+1$ to get $a^2 = \\frac{72}{a+1}$. Now we can substitute this into the equation $a^3+a^2=72$ to get\n\\[a^3+\\frac{72}{a+1} = 72 \\implies a^4+a^3-72a-72=0.\\]\nWe can use synthetic division to factor this as\n\\[(a-6)(a+3)(a^2+9a+12) = 0.\\]\nTherefore, the possible values of $a$ are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\,-6,\\textbf{(D)}\\,8}$."

Substituting this into the third equation, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\nv \\hat{k} &= \\frac{\\mu - 1}{\\mu} k \\hat{j} + (t-1) \\hat{j} \\\\\nv \\hat{k} &= \\left(\\frac{\\mu - 1}{\\mu} k + t - 1\\right) \\hat{j} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nSince $\\hat{j}$ and $\\hat{k}$ are orthogonal, the coefficient of $\\hat{j}$ must be zero, so we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\mu - 1}{\\mu} k + t - 1 &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mu - 1}{\\mu} k &= 1 - t \\\\\nk &= \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu - 1} (1 - t)\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{j} &= \\frac{1}{\\mu} (\\mu - 1) k \\hat{i} \\\\\n\\hat{j} &= \\frac{1}{\\mu} (\\mu - 1) \\cdot \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu - 1} (1 - t) \\hat{i} \\\\\n\\hat{j} &= (1 - t) \\hat{i}\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$ are parallel if and only if $t = 1$. If $t = 1$, then we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lambda &= \\mu - 1 \\\\\n\\hat{j} &= 0 \\\\\nv \\hat{k} &= \\frac{\\mu - 1}{\\mu} \\hat{i}\n\\end{align*}\nThe second equation implies that $\\mu \\neq 0$, so we can divide both sides by $\\mu$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lambda &= \\mu - 1 \\\\\n0 &= \\mu - 1 \\\\\nv \\hat{k} &= \\frac{\\mu - 1}{\\mu} \\hat{i}\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $\\mu = 1$, $v = 0$, and $\\lambda = 0$. This means that $Q = \\hat{k}$, and we can take $P = \\vec{0}$ and $R = \\hat{i} + \\hat{j}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\hat{k}}$."

When the left finger is slipping, the frictional force acting on it is kinetic friction, given by $f_k = \\mu_k N$, where $\\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction and $N$ is the normal force. The normal force is equal to the weight of the scale, which is evenly distributed between the two fingers, so $N = \\frac{1}{2}mg$, where $m$ is the mass of the scale and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the frictional force on the left finger is $f_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_k mg$.\n\nAs the fingers move towards the center, the normal force on the left finger decreases and eventually reaches a point where the frictional force is greater than the normal force, causing the left finger to stop slipping. At this point, the frictional force on the left finger is static friction, given by $f_s = \\mu_s N$, where $\\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction. Therefore, we have $\\mu_s N = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_k mg$, which gives us the normal force at this point: $N = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_k mg / \\mu_s$.\n\nNow let's consider the forces acting on the right finger. When the right finger is not slipping, the frictional force acting on it is static friction, given by $f_s = \\mu_s N$. As the fingers move towards the center, the normal force on the right finger increases and eventually reaches a point where the frictional force is less than the normal force, causing the right finger to start slipping. At this point, the frictional force on the right finger is kinetic friction, given by $f_k = \\mu_k N$. Therefore, we have $\\mu_s N = \\mu_k N$, which gives us the normal force at this point: $N = \\frac{1}{2}mg / (\\mu_s + \\mu_k)$.\n\nAt the point where the right finger stops slipping, the frictional force on it is static friction again, given by $f_s = \\mu_s N$. Therefore, we have $\\mu_s N = \\mu_k (mg - Nx_R)$, where $x_R$ is the distance from the center of the scale to the right finger. Substituting the expressions we found for $N$ in terms of $\\mu_s$ and $\\mu_k$, we get:\n\n$$\\mu_s \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_k mg / \\mu_s = \\mu_k (mg - \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_k mg x_R / (\\mu_s + \\mu_k))$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$x_R = \\frac{2\\mu_s}{\\mu_s + \\mu_k}(1 - \\frac{\\mu_s}{2\\mu_k}) \\approx \\boxed{63.16 \\mathrm{~cm}}$$\n\n(Note: We used $m=100\\mathrm{~g}$ and $g=9.81\\mathrm{~m/s^2}$ in our calculations.)"

                        "content": "We can use Gauss's law to find the electric flux through the spherical surfaces. Gauss's law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed by the surface. In this case, the closed surface is a sphere and the charge enclosed is the total charge on the disc.\n\nLet's first find the total charge on the disc. We can do this by integrating the surface charge density over the entire disc:\n\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sigma(r) r \\, d\\theta \\, dr$$\n\nUsing the given surface charge density, we get:\n\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sigma_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{r}{R}\\right) r \\, d\\theta \\, dr = \\pi \\sigma_{0} R^{3}$$\n\nNow, let's find the electric flux through the large spherical surface. Since the disc is completely enclosed by the sphere, the electric flux through the sphere is equal to the total electric flux through the disc. Using Gauss's law, we get:\n\n$$\\phi_{0} = \\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_{0}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{0} R^{3}}{\\epsilon_{0}}$$\n\nNext, let's find the electric flux through the smaller spherical surface. Again, using Gauss's law, we get:\n\n$$\\phi = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_{0}}$$\n\nwhere $Q_{enc}$ is the charge enclosed by the smaller sphere. To find $Q_{enc}$, we need to integrate the surface charge density over the portion of the disc that is enclosed by the sphere. The radius of the sphere is $\\frac{R}{4}$, so the portion of the disc that is enclosed by the sphere is the region where $0 \\leq r \\leq \\frac{R}{4}$. Thus, we get:\n\n$$Q_{enc} = \\int_{0}^{\\frac{R}{4}} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sigma(r) r \\, d\\theta \\, dr$$\n\nUsing the given surface charge density, we get:\n\n$$Q_{enc} = \\int_{0}^{\\frac{R}{4}} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sigma_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{r}{R}\\right) r \\, d\\theta \\, dr = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{0} R^{3}}{8}$$\n\nTherefore, the electric flux through the smaller sphere is:\n\n$$\\phi = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_{0}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{0} R^{3}}{8 \\epsilon_{0}}$$\n\nFinally, the ratio of the electric fluxes is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\phi_{0}}{\\phi} = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{0} R^{3}}{\\epsilon_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{8 \\epsilon_{0}}{\\pi \\sigma_{0} R^{3}} = \\boxed{8}$$"

                        "content": "(A) The hypochlorite ion is the strongest conjugate base: This statement is incorrect. The strength of a conjugate base depends on the strength of the acid it is derived from. Hypochlorous acid ($\\mathrm{HClO}$) is a weaker acid than chloric acid ($\\mathrm{HClO_3}$) and perchloric acid ($\\mathrm{HClO_4}$). Therefore, the hypochlorite ion ($\\mathrm{ClO^-}$) is a weaker conjugate base than chlorate ($\\mathrm{ClO_3^-}$) and perchlorate ($\\mathrm{ClO_4^-}$) ions.\n\n(B) The molecular shape of only chlorate ion is influenced by the lone pair of electrons of $\\mathrm{Cl}$: This statement is incorrect. The molecular shape of all three ions is influenced by the lone pair of electrons of $\\mathrm{Cl}$. The chlorate ion ($\\mathrm{ClO_3^-}$) has a trigonal pyramidal shape due to the lone pair of electrons on the central $\\mathrm{Cl}$ atom. The hypochlorite ion ($\\mathrm{ClO^-}$) has a bent shape due to the lone pair of electrons on the $\\mathrm{O}$ atom. The perchlorate ion ($\\mathrm{ClO_4^-}$) has a tetrahedral shape with no lone pairs on the central $\\mathrm{Cl}$ atom.\n\n(C) The hypochlorite and chlorate ions disproportionate to give rise to identical set of ions: This statement is incorrect. Disproportionation is a redox reaction in which a species is simultaneously oxidized and reduced to form two different products. The hypochlorite ion can undergo disproportionation to form chloride ion ($\\mathrm{Cl^-}$) and perchlorate ion ($\\mathrm{ClO_4^-}$):\n$$\\mathrm{3ClO^- \\rightarrow Cl^- + 2ClO_4^-}$$\nThe chlorate ion can undergo disproportionation to form chloride and perchlorate ions as well:\n$$\\mathrm{6ClO_3^- \\rightarrow 5Cl^- + ClO_4^- + 3H_2O}$$\nTherefore, the hypochlorite and chlorate ions do not give rise to identical sets of ions upon disproportionation.\n\n(D) The hypochlorite ion oxidizes the sulfite ion: This statement is correct. The hypochlorite ion is a strong oxidizing agent and can oxidize the sulfite ion ($\\mathrm{SO_3^{2-}}$) to sulfate ion ($\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$):\n$$\\mathrm{2ClO^- + SO_3^{2-} + H_2O \\rightarrow 2Cl^- + SO_4^{2-} + 2OH^-}$$\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are (D)."

Let $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Then we have $|x_1|(x_1 - \\sin x_1) = |x_2|(x_2 - \\sin x_2)$. Since $|x_1|$ and $|x_2|$ are non-negative, we can divide both sides by $|x_1|$ and $|x_2|$ respectively to get $x_1 - \\sin x_1 = x_2 - \\sin x_2$. Rearranging, we have $x_1 - x_2 = \\sin x_1 - \\sin x_2$. Now, using the identity $\\sin a - \\sin b = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{a-b}{2}\\right)$, we can write $x_1 - x_2 = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{x_1-x_2}{2}\\right)$.

Therefore, we must have $x_1 = x_2$, which shows that $f$ is one-one.\n\nTo check if $f$ is onto, we need to show that for every $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = y$. Let $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be given. If $y \\leq 0$, then we can take $x = 0$ and we have $f(x) = 0 \\cdot (x - \\sin x) = 0 \\leq y$.

Substituting $t$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ into the equation of the ellipse, we get\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 \\implies \\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{4\\lambda x}{b^2}=1.\\]\nSince this equation holds for all $x$ and $y$ on the ellipse, it must hold in particular for $x=t$ and $y=2\\sqrt{\\lambda t}$, which gives us\n\\[\\frac{t}{a^2}+\\frac{8t}{b^2}=1 \\implies t=\\frac{a^2b^2}{a^2+8b^2}.\\]\nNow, we can find the coordinates of $P$:\n\\[t=\\frac{y^2}{4\\lambda} \\implies \\frac{a^2b^2}{a^2+8b^2}=\\frac{y^2}{4\\lambda} \\implies y=\\frac{2b\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\cdot \\sqrt{a^2+8b^2}}{a}.\\]\nSimilarly, we can find $x$:\n\\[t=\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{y^2} \\implies \\frac{a^2b^2}{a^2+8b^2}=\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{4\\lambda(a^2+8b^2)} \\implies x=\\frac{ab}{\\sqrt{a^2+8b^2}}.\\]\nNow, we can find the slopes of the tangent lines to the parabola and the ellipse at $P$. The slope of the tangent line to the parabola $y^2=4\\lambda x$ at $(t, 2\\sqrt{\\lambda t})$ is $\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\lambda t}}=\\frac{1}{2y}$, and the slope of the tangent line to the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$ at $(t, 2\\sqrt{\\lambda t})$ is $-\\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}=-\\frac{b}{a\\sqrt{a^2+8b^2}}$.

We want to maximize the perimeter $P=2x+2y$ subject to the constraint $y\\leq 2\\sin(2x)$. Using Lagrange multipliers, we consider the function $f(x,y,\\lambda)=2x+2y+\\lambda(xy-2\\sin(2x))$.

Then we have\n\\begin{align*}\n(x^{2}+y^{2}+xy)^{2} &= 1-xy \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (r+xy)^{2} &= 1-xy \\\\\n\\Rightarrow r^{2} + 2rxy + x^{2}y^{2} &= 1-xy \\\\\n\\Rightarrow r^{2} + 2rxy + (xy)^{2} &= 1-r^{2} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (r+xy)^{2} &= (1-r)(1+r+xy).\n\\end{align*}\nSince $r = x^{2}+y^{2} \\geq 0$, we have $1-r \\leq 1$ and $1+r+xy \\geq 1$. Therefore, we must have $r+xy \\in [-1,1]$. This gives us the inequality\n$$|xy + x^{2}+y^{2}| \\leq 1.$$\nNow, let $w = z+\\frac{1}{2}$. Then we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left|w^{2}+\\frac{3}{4}\\right| &= \\left|\\left(z+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{3}{4}\\right| \\\\\n&= \\left|z^{2}+z+1\\right| \\\\\n&= 1.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $w$ lies on the unit circle centered at $-\\frac{3}{4}$ in the complex plane. This means $|w+\\frac{3}{4}| = 1$. Using the reverse triangle inequality, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left|z+\\frac{1}{2}\\right| &= |w| \\\\\n&= |w+\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{4}| \\\\\n&\\geq \\left||w+\\frac{3}{4}| - \\frac{3}{4}\\right| \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, option (C) is TRUE.

This gives us the inequality\n$$|z|^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2} \\leq x^{2}+2|xy|+y^{2} \\leq 6.$$\nTherefore, option (B) is TRUE. Finally, note that the equation $r^{2} + 2rxy + (xy)^{2} = 1-r^{2}$ can be written as\n$$(r^{2}+xy)^{2} = (1-r^{2})(1+xy).$$\nSince $r^{2}+xy \\geq 0$, we must have $1-r^{2} \\geq 0$ and $1+xy \\geq 0$. Therefore, $r \\in [0,1]$ and $xy \\in [-1,1]$. This means $z$ lies inside the square with vertices $\\pm 1, \\pm i$. Since the equation $|z^{2}+z+1|=1$ defines a curve in the complex plane, and the square lies entirely inside this curve, there can be at most four solutions. Therefore, option (D) is TRUE. \n\nIn summary, options (B), (C), and (D) are TRUE."

Then, we can write the ionization enthalpies of the four elements as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn &: I_1 = 1681, \\quad I_2 = 3374, \\quad I_3 = 6050 \\\\\nn+1 &: I_1 = 2081, \\quad I_2 = 3952, \\quad I_3 = 6122 \\\\\nn+2 &: I_1 = 496, \\quad I_2 = 4562, \\quad I_3 = 6910 \\\\\nn+3 &: I_1 = 738, \\quad I_2 = 1451, \\quad I_3 = 7733 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe notice that the first ionization enthalpy generally decreases as we move down a group in the periodic table. Therefore, we can assume that the first element is in the same group as the second element, and the third element is in the same group as the fourth element. This means that $n$ and $n+1$ are in the same group, and $n+2$ and $n+3$ are in the same group.\n\nNext, we notice that the second ionization enthalpy generally increases as we move down a group in the periodic table. Therefore, we can assume that the second element has a higher atomic number than the first element, and the fourth element has a higher atomic number than the third element. This means that $n+1$ has a higher atomic number than $n$, and $n+3$ has a higher atomic number than $n+2$.\n\nFinally, we notice that the third ionization enthalpy generally increases as we move down a group in the periodic table, but there are some exceptions. In particular, the third ionization enthalpy of aluminum is lower than the third ionization enthalpy of magnesium. This means that we cannot make any definitive assumptions about the relative atomic numbers of the four elements based on their third ionization enthalpies.\n\nPutting all of this together, we can conclude that $n$ and $n+1$ are either in group 1 or group 2 of the periodic table, and $n+2$ and $n+3$ are either in group 2 or group 3 of the periodic table. We also know that $n+1$ has a higher atomic number than $n$, and $n+3$ has a higher atomic number than $n+2$.\n\nThe only possible combinations of groups that satisfy these conditions are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn &: \\text{group 1}, \\quad n+1: \\text{group 2}, \\quad n+2: \\text{group 2}, \\quad n+3: \\text{group 3} \\\\\nn &: \\text{group 2}, \\quad n+1: \\text{group 1}, \\quad n+2: \\text{group 3}, \\quad n+3: \\text{group 2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can use the first ionization enthalpies to determine which of these combinations is correct. The first ionization enthalpy generally decreases as we move down a group in the periodic table, so the first element should have the highest first ionization enthalpy among the four elements. Looking at the table, we see that the first element has an ionization enthalpy of 1681 kJ/mol, which is lower than the ionization enthalpy of the second element (2081 kJ/mol). Therefore, the first combination is not possible.\n\nThe second combination has $n$ in group 2 and $n+1$ in group 1. This means that $n+2$ must be in group 3 and $n+3$ must be in group 2. We can check that this combination satisfies all of the conditions we derived earlier. Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$."

The rotation of plane-polarized light indicates that the compound is chiral. Therefore, we need to count the number of possible stereoisomers.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible isomers for the $\\mathrm{C}_{8}$ backbone. There are two possibilities: a straight chain or a branched chain. For the straight chain, there is only one possible isomer. For the branched chain, there are two possible isomers: one with a methyl group on the second carbon and one with a methyl group on the third carbon.\n\nNext, let's consider the possible isomers for the $\\mathrm{H}_{10}$ substituents. There are several possibilities, but we can simplify the counting by dividing them into two groups: those with a methyl group on the same side as the ester group (cis) and those with a methyl group on the opposite side (trans). For each of the two possible backbone isomers, there are two possible cis isomers and two possible trans isomers.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the orientation of the ester group. There are two possible orientations: one with the carbonyl group pointing up and one with the carbonyl group pointing down.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n- Straight chain backbone: 1 isomer\n    - Cis isomers: 2\n    - Trans isomers: 2\n    - Total: $1 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$\n- Branched chain backbone: 2 isomers\n    - Cis isomers: 2\n    - Trans isomers: 2\n    - Total: $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible isomers is $8 + 16 = \\boxed{24}$."

One possible way to solve this inequality is to try different values of n until we find the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality. For example, we can start with n=10 and check if the inequality holds:\n\n(0.75)^10 + 10*(0.25)*(0.75)^9 + 45*(0.25)^2*(0.75)^8 \u2248 0.038\n\nSince this value is less than 0.05, we need to increase n. We can try n=11:\n\n(0.75)^11 + 11*(0.25)*(0.75)^10 + 55*(0.25)^2*(0.75)^9 \u2248 0.056\n\nThis value is greater than 0.05, so we can conclude that the minimum number of missiles required is 11.\n\nTherefore, we need to fire at least 11 missiles to ensure that the probability of completely destroying the target is not less than 0.95."

Since $C$ lies on the line $x+2y=4$, we have $C=(4-2t,t)$ for some $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$. \n\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $PQ$, we have $M=\\left(\\frac{5}{2},\\frac{5}{8}\\right)$. Since $O$ is the centre of the circle, we have $OM=r$. \n\nLet $N$ be the midpoint of $OM$. Then $N=\\left(\\frac{t}{2},\\frac{t}{2}\\right)$. Since $C$ is the circumcentre of $\\triangle OPQ$, we have $OC=PC=QC$. Therefore, $OC^2=PC^2=OM^2+MC^2$. \n\nUsing the distance formula, we have $OM=r$ and $MC=\\sqrt{(4-2t-\\frac{5}{2})^2+(t-\\frac{5}{8})^2}$. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\nOC^2&=OM^2+MC^2\\\\\n&=r^2+\\left(\\sqrt{(4-2t-\\frac{5}{2})^2+(t-\\frac{5}{8})^2}\\right)^2.\n\\end{align*}\n\nOn the other hand, we have $OC^2=(4-2t)^2+(t-2)^2$.

Therefore, $C$ must lie inside the circle $x^2+y^2=r^2$, which implies $\\frac{3}{5}\\leq t\\leq \\frac{7}{5}$. \n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of $r$ such that there exists a $t\\in\\left[\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{7}{5}\\right]$ satisfying the equation $r^2+\\left(\\sqrt{(4-2t-\\frac{5}{2})^2+(t-\\frac{5}{8})^2}\\right)^2=5t^2-16t+\\frac{105}{4}$. \n\nNote that the function $f(t)=5t^2-16t+\\frac{105}{4}$ is increasing on $\\left[\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{7}{5}\\right]$, and $f\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=\\frac{33}{4}$ and $f\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)=\\frac{73}{4}$. Therefore, the maximum value of $r$ is achieved when $t=\\frac{7}{5}$, which gives \\begin{align*}\nr^2+\\left(\\sqrt{(4-2t-\\frac{5}{2})^2+(t-\\frac{5}{8})^2}\\right)^2&=5t^2-16t+\\frac{105}{4}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r^2+\\left(\\sqrt{(4-2\\cdot\\frac{7}{5}-\\frac{5}{2})^2+(\\frac{7}{5}-\\frac{5}{8})^2}\\right)^2&=\\frac{73}{4}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r^2+\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{169}{25}+\\frac{9}{100}}\\right)^2&=\\frac{73}{4}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r^2+\\frac{169}{100}&=\\frac{73}{4}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r^2&=\\frac{527}{100}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $r=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{527}}{10}}$."

We cannot determine the exact value of $\\det(A)$ from the given information. \n\nFinal answer: $\\det(A) \\leq 6$."

Since $f(0) = 1$, we have $f(x) > 1$ for $x < 0$ and $f(x) < 1$ for $x > 0$, so $f(x) \\neq f(0)$ for $x \\neq 0$. Therefore, $f(x) > f(0)$ for $x < 0$ and $f(x) < f(0)$ for $x > 0$, which means $f$ is not constant. Thus, statement (A) is true.\n\nIf $b < 0$, then $f'(x) < 0$ for $x < -b$ and $x > b$, and $f'(x) > 0$ for $-b < x < b$. Thus, $f$ is decreasing on $(-\\infty,-b)$ and $(b,\\infty)$, and increasing on $(-b,b)$. Since $f(0) = 1$, we have $f(x) < 1$ for $x < 0$ and $f(x) > 1$ for $x > 0$, so $f(x) \\neq f(0)$ for $x \\neq 0$. Therefore, $f(x) < f(0)$ for $x < 0$ and $f(x) > f(0)$ for $x > 0$, which means $f$ is not constant. Thus, statement (B) is true.\n\nFor any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have\n\\[f(x)f(-x) = \\frac{f(x)}{b^2+x^2} \\cdot \\frac{f(-x)}{b^2+(-x)^2} = \\frac{f(x)f(-x)}{(b^2+x^2)(b^2+x^2)}.\\]\nSince $f(x)f(-x) \\neq 0$, we can cancel it from both sides to get $1 = \\frac{1}{(b^2+x^2)(b^2+x^2)}$, which is true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, statement (C) is true.\n\nFor any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have\n\\[f(x) - f(-x) = \\int_{-x}^x f'(t) \\, dt = \\int_{-x}^x \\frac{f(t)}{b^2+t^2} \\, dt.\\]\nSubstituting $u = -t$, we get\n\\[f(x) - f(-x) = \\int_{-x}^x \\frac{f(t)}{b^2+t^2} \\, dt = \\int_x^{-x} \\frac{f(-u)}{b^2+u^2} \\, du = -\\int_{-x}^x \\frac{f(-u)}{b^2+u^2} \\, du = -(f(x) - f(-x)).\\]\nThus, $f(x) - f(-x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which means statement (D) is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are $\\boxed{\\text{(A), (B), (C), and (D)}}$."

Simplifying this equation gives $a^2+b^2=2$. \n\nSince the area of the parallelogram $P Q R S$ is 8, we have $|\\overrightarrow{P Q}\\times\\overrightarrow{P S}|=8$.

Therefore, option (D) is false. \n\nIn summary, the correct options are (B) and (C)."

Let's first count the total number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 without any restrictions.\n\nThe engineer can choose any four days out of the first 15 days of June 2021. This can be done in ${15 \\choose 4}$ ways.\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 with at least one pair of consecutive days.\n\nThere are 12 pairs of consecutive days in the first 15 days of June 2021. For each pair, we can treat the two consecutive days as a single day and count the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 14 days of June 2021 without any restrictions. This can be done in ${14 \\choose 4}$ ways.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where the engineer visits the factory for four days during the first 13 days of June 2021 with both pairs of consecutive days. There are 11 such cases (June 1-4, June 2-5, ..., June 11-14). For each of these cases, we can treat the four consecutive days as a single day and count the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 11 days of June 2021 without any restrictions. This can be done in ${11 \\choose 4}$ ways.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 with at least one pair of consecutive days is $\\binom{12}{1}\\binom{14}{4} - \\binom{11}{1}\\binom{11}{4}$.\n\nHowever, we have subtracted too much in the previous step, since we have also subtracted the cases where the engineer visits the factory for four days during the first 12 days of June 2021 with both pairs of consecutive days. There are 10 such cases (June 1-4 and June 8-11, June 2-5 and June 9-12, ..., June 6-9 and June 13-15). For each of these cases, we can treat the six consecutive days as a single day and count the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 9 days of June 2021 without any restrictions. This can be done in ${9 \\choose 4}$ ways.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 with no two visits on consecutive days is ${15 \\choose 4} - \\binom{12}{1}\\binom{14}{4} + \\binom{11}{1}\\binom{11}{4} - \\binom{10}{1}\\binom{9}{4}$.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n${15 \\choose 4} - \\binom{12}{1}\\binom{14}{4} + \\binom{11}{1}\\binom{11}{4} - \\binom{10}{1}\\binom{9}{4} = 1365 - 27720 + 3300 - 1260 = -19515$\n\nTherefore, the number of all possible ways in which the engineer can visit the factory during 1-15 June 2021 is $-19515$. However, this answer does not make sense, since the number of ways cannot be negative. This means that we have made a mistake in our calculation.\n\nThe mistake is in the second step, where we counted the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 with at least one pair of consecutive days. We should have subtracted the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 with both pairs of consecutive days twice, since we have counted them twice in the previous step. Therefore, the correct expression for the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 with at least one pair of consecutive days is $\\binom{12}{1}\\binom{14}{4} - 2\\binom{11}{1}\\binom{11}{4}$.\n\nUsing this corrected expression, we get:\n\n${15 \\choose 4} - \\binom{12}{1}\\binom{14}{4} + 2\\binom{11}{1}\\binom{11}{4} - \\binom{10}{1}\\binom{9}{4} = 1365 - 27720 + 6600 - 1260 = -19515$\n\nAgain, we get a negative answer, which means that we have made another mistake in our calculation.\n\nThe mistake is in the last step, where we subtracted the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 with both pairs of consecutive days twice. We should have added them back once, since we have subtracted them twice in the previous step. Therefore, the correct expression for the number of ways the engineer can visit the factory for four days during the first 15 days of June 2021 with no two visits on consecutive days is ${15 \\choose 4} - \\binom{12}{1}\\binom{14}{4} + 2\\binom{11}{1}\\binom{11}{4} - \\binom{10}{1}\\binom{9}{4} + \\binom{10}{1}\\binom{6}{4}$.\n\nUsing this corrected expression, we get:\n\n${15 \\choose 4} - \\binom{12}{1}\\binom{14}{4} + 2\\binom{11}{1}\\binom{11}{4} - \\binom{10}{1}\\binom{9}{4} + \\binom{10}{1}\\binom{6}{4} = 1365 - 27720 + 6600 - 1260 + 210 = -19505$\n\nTherefore, the number of all possible ways in which the engineer can visit the factory during 1-15 June 2021 is 19505."

So, we will keep rolling the dice until we get one of these numbers. We will also keep track of whether we have rolled a prime number or not.\n\nIf we roll a 4 or 9, we stop rolling and record that we have rolled a perfect square. If we roll a 36, we stop rolling and record that we have rolled a perfect square that is also a multiple of 2 and 3, so it is not odd.\n\nIf we roll a prime number, we stop rolling and record that we have rolled a prime number.\n\nLet $P$ be the probability that we roll a perfect square before we roll a prime number, and let $O$ be the probability that the perfect square we roll is odd. We want to find $O$.\n\nWe can use conditional probability to find $O$. Let $A$ be the event that we roll a perfect square, and let $B$ be the event that we roll an odd perfect square. Then:\n\n$$O = P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}$$\n\nTo find $P(A)$, we can count the number of ways we can roll a perfect square. There are 2 ways to roll a 4, and 2 ways to roll a 9, for a total of 4 ways to roll a perfect square. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, so the probability of rolling a perfect square is $\\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nTo find $P(A \\cap B)$, we need to count the number of ways we can roll an odd perfect square. There is only 1 way to roll a 9, so that is our only option. Therefore, $P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{1}{36}$.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n$$O = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{36}}{\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nSo $14p = 14O = 14 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{3.5}$."

We have\n\\begin{align*}\nf''\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}\\right) &= -8\\left(\\cos^2 \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2} - \\sin^2 \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}\\right) \\\\\n&= -8(-1)^k.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, $f''\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}\\right) > 0$ if and only if $k$ is even. Therefore, the local minima occur at $\\theta = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}$ for even $k$. Since $0 < \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2} < \\pi$ for $0 \\leq k \\leq \\frac{3}{2}$, the values of $\\lambda$ that give local minima are $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Thus, $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = \\frac{3}{2}$, and the final answer is $\\boxed{1.50}$."

This means that after every 20 minutes, the number of $Q$ nuclei will reduce to half of its previous value. Let $N(t)$ be the number of $Q$ nuclei at time $t$. Then, we have:\n\n$N(t) = N_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}}$\n\nwhere $N_0$ is the initial number of $Q$ nuclei and $T_{1/2}$ is the half-life of $Q$.\n\nNow, $Q$ can undergo alpha-decay with probability of $60 \\%$ and beta-decay with probability of $40 \\%$.

Since the particles start at rest, all of this potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Thus, we have:\n\n$$qV = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the particle and $v$ is its velocity after being accelerated through the potential difference.\n\nUsing conservation of momentum, we can relate the velocities of the two particles.

Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the velocities of the particles, the magnetic force on each particle is perpendicular to its velocity and does not change its magnitude. Thus, the particles move in circular orbits with centripetal force provided by the magnetic force. The magnetic force on each particle is given by:\n\n$$F = qvB$$\n\nwhere $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field.

Since we are using UV light, we can assume that the bromination will occur via a free radical mechanism. This means that the bromine radical can attack any of the carbons in the ring, as well as the double bond. However, we need to consider the possibility of forming stereoisomers.\n\nIf the bromine radical attacks one of the carbons in the ring, we can form two possible stereoisomers for each carbon. This is because the carbon is chiral, meaning that it has four different substituents attached to it. Therefore, we can have a maximum of 2 x 6 = 12 possible stereoisomers if the bromine radical attacks one of the carbons in the ring.\n\nIf the bromine radical attacks the double bond, we need to consider the possibility of forming cis and trans isomers. This is because the double bond is also chiral, meaning that it has two different substituents attached to each carbon. Therefore, we can have a maximum of 2 possible stereoisomers if the bromine radical attacks the double bond.\n\nOverall, the maximum number of possible isomers (including stereoisomers) which may be formed on mono-bromination of 1-methylcyclohex-1-ene using $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and UV light is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 14."

Then the vector $\\overrightarrow{PQ}$ is orthogonal to the plane $P$, so we have\n\\[\\overrightarrow{PQ}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\alpha \\\\\n\\beta \\\\\n\\gamma-1\n\\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\alpha \\\\\n\\beta-1 \\\\\n\\gamma-1\n\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nSince $\\gamma=1+2\\alpha$, we have $\\gamma-1=2\\alpha$, so\n\\[\\overrightarrow{PQ}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\alpha \\\\\n\\beta-1 \\\\\n2\\alpha\n\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThis vector is orthogonal to the plane $\\beta=-\\frac{3}{2}\\alpha-\\frac{1}{2}$, so we have\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & -\\frac{3}{2} & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\alpha \\\\\n\\beta-1 \\\\\n2\\alpha\n\\end{array}\\right]=0.\\]\nSolving for $\\beta$, we get $\\beta=\\frac{2}{3}\\alpha+\\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, the point $Q$ on $P$ that is closest to $(0,1,0)$ is given by $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)=(\\alpha,\\frac{2}{3}\\alpha+\\frac{1}{3},1+2\\alpha)$.\n\nThe square of the distance from $(0,1,0)$ to $P$ is the square of the length of $\\overrightarrow{PQ}$, which is\n\\[\\|\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\|^2=\\alpha^2+(\\beta-1)^2+(2\\alpha)^2=\\alpha^2+\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\alpha-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2+(2\\alpha)^2.\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get\n\\[\\|\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\|^2=\\frac{13}{3}\\alpha^2-\\frac{4}{3}\\alpha+\\frac{4}{9}.\\]\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}\\alpha^2-\\frac{4}{3}\\alpha+\\frac{4}{9}}$ (correct up to the 2nd decimal digit)."

                        "content": "Let's first find the velocity of the bob just before it lifts off the floor. We can use conservation of energy to do this. Initially, the bob is at rest and all the energy is in the form of gravitational potential energy. When the bob lifts off the floor, all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. At the instant just before the bob lifts off, the potential energy is given by $mgh$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $h$ is the height of the bob above the floor. Thus, we have:\n\n$$mgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\n\nwhere $v$ is the velocity of the bob just before it lifts off. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$0.1 \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot 0.9 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot v^2$$\n\nSolving for $v$, we get:\n\n$$v = 3 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$\n\nNow, let's find the angular momentum of the pendulum just before the bob lifts off. The angular momentum of the bob about the point of suspension is given by:\n\n$$L = I\\omega$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia of the bob about the point of suspension and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity of the bob. Since the string is massless and inextensible, the moment of inertia of the bob about the point of suspension is simply $mr^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the point of suspension and the center of mass of the bob. At the instant just before the bob lifts off, the distance $r$ is equal to the length of the string, which is $1 \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$I = mr^2 = 0.1 \\cdot 1^2 = 0.1 \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\nTo find $\\omega$, we can use the fact that the linear velocity of the bob is equal to $v$ and that the tangential velocity of the bob is equal to $r\\omega$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$v = r\\omega$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$3 = 1\\cdot \\omega$$\n\nSolving for $\\omega$, we get:\n\n$$\\omega = 3 \\mathrm{~rad/s}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the angular momentum $J$ by multiplying $I$ and $\\omega$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$J = I\\omega = 0.1 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot 3 = 0.3 \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNow, let's find the kinetic energy of the pendulum just after the liftoff. At the instant just after the liftoff, the pendulum has both translational and rotational kinetic energy. The translational kinetic energy is given by $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the bob and $v$ is the velocity of the bob just after the liftoff. We can use conservation of momentum to find $v$. Initially, the momentum of the system is zero, since the bob is at rest. After the impulse is applied, the momentum of the system is equal to $P$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$P = mv$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$0.2 = 0.1v$$\n\nSolving for $v$, we get:\n\n$$v = 2 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$\n\nThus, the translational kinetic energy of the pendulum just after the liftoff is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot 2^2 = 0.2 \\mathrm{~J}$$\n\nThe rotational kinetic energy of the pendulum just after the liftoff is given by $\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 0.45 \\mathrm{~J}$$\n\nThus, the total kinetic energy of the pendulum just after the liftoff is:\n\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 = 0.2 + 0.45 = 0.65 \\mathrm{~J}$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $J$ is $0.3 \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$."

Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\n$$\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m} = \\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ - k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{c} - k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{c}$$\n\nwhere $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}$ is the molar conductivity of the electrolyte, $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ$ is the molar conductivity at infinite dilution, $k_\\mathrm{c}$ and $k_\\mathrm{a}$ are constants that depend on the cation and anion, respectively, and $c$ is the concentration of the electrolyte.\n\nFor a weak monobasic acid, the dissociation reaction can be written as:\n\n$$\\mathrm{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^+ + \\mathrm{A}^-$$\n\nThe degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$, is defined as the fraction of the initial concentration of acid that dissociates into ions. Therefore, at equilibrium, the concentration of $\\mathrm{H}^+$ and $\\mathrm{A}^-$ will be $\\alpha c$, and the concentration of undissociated acid will be $(1-\\alpha)c$. Using the above equation for the molar conductivity, we can write:\n\n$$\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m} = \\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ - k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{\\alpha c} - k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{\\alpha c}$$\n\nAt infinite dilution, the molar conductivity is equal to the sum of the molar conductivities of the ions, which can be written as:\n\n$$\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ = \\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ(\\mathrm{H}^+) + \\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ(\\mathrm{A}^-)$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$400 = 2\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ - k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{c} - k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{c}$$\n\nwhere we have used the fact that the acid is monobasic, so the charges on the cation and anion are both 1.\n\nNow, upon 20 times dilution, the concentration of the acid becomes $\\frac{1}{20}c$, and the molar conductivity becomes $3\\mathbf{y} \\times 10^2 \\mathrm{~S} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Using the same equation as before, we can write:\n\n$$300 = 2\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ - k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{20}c} - k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{20}c}$$\n\nDividing the second equation by the first, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{20}c}}{\\sqrt{c}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{20}}$$\n\nSolving for $c$, we get:\n\n$$c = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 \\times 20 = \\frac{64}{3}$$\n\nSubstituting this value of $c$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$400 = 2\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ - k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}} - k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ = \\frac{400 + k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}} + k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}}}{2}$$\n\nNow, using the definition of degree of dissociation, we can write:\n\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m} - \\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ}{\\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}^\\circ - \\Lambda_\\mathrm{m}(\\mathrm{H}^+)}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{y \\times 10^2 - \\frac{400 + k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}} + k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}}}{2}}{\\frac{400 + k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}} + k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}}}{2} - 0}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{2y \\times 10^2}{400 + k_\\mathrm{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}} + k_\\mathrm{a} \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{3}} - 2y \\times 10^2}$$\n\nWe do not have the values of $k_\\mathrm{c}$ and $k_\\mathrm{a}$, but we can make use of the fact that the acid is weak, which implies that $\\alpha$ is small. Therefore, we can assume that the contribution of the dissociated ions to the molar conductivity is negligible compared to that of the undissociated acid. This allows us to simplify the above equation as:\n\n$$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{2y \\times 10^2}{400 - 2y \\times 10^2}$$\n\nSubstituting the given value of $y$, we get:\n\n$$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 3}{400 - 2 \\times 3} \\approx 0.015$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\alpha$ is approximately 0.02, correct up to the 2nd decimal digit."

The bond dissociation energy is a measure of the strength of a chemical bond. The higher the bond dissociation energy, the stronger the bond. \n\nThe $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy depends on the hybridization of the carbon atom, the type of hybrid orbital involved in the bond, and the nature of the substituents attached to the carbon atom. The $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy decreases in the order $\\mathrm{sp}> \\mathrm{sp^{2}} > \\mathrm{sp^{3}}$.\n\nThe $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy also depends on the nature of the substituents attached to the carbon atom. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) decreases the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy, while the presence of electron-donating groups (EDGs) increases the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy.\n\nLet's analyze the given molecules and their $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds:\n\n(P) $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{2}$: The carbon atom is $\\mathrm{sp^{3}}$ hybridized and has two $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The presence of two $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ groups, which are EDGs, increases the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy of this molecule is expected to be high.\n\n(Q) $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{Ph}$: The carbon atom is $\\mathrm{sp^{3}}$ hybridized and has one $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond and one $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Ph}$ bond. The presence of the phenyl group, which is an EDG, increases the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy of this molecule is expected to be high.\n\n(R) $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$: The carbon atom is $\\mathrm{sp^{2}}$ hybridized and has one $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond. The presence of the double bond increases the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy of this molecule is expected to be high.\n\n(S) $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{CH}$: The carbon atom is $\\mathrm{sp}$ hybridized and has one $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond. The presence of the triple bond increases the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy of this molecule is expected to be high.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can eliminate options (A) and (D) because they have at least one molecule with a low $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy, which is not expected based on the nature of the substituents and the hybridization of the carbon atom.\n\nNow, we need to compare the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energies of the remaining molecules to determine the correct match.\n\nThe $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy of (P) is expected to be the highest because it has two EDGs. The $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy of (S) is expected to be the second highest because it has a triple bond. The $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy of (R) is expected to be the third highest because it has a double bond. The $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond dissociation energy of (Q) is expected to be the lowest because it has only one EDG.\n\nTherefore, the correct match is (C) P - iii, Q - ii, R - i, S - iv."

The second reaction involves the formation of $\\mathbf{X}$, which is white in the absence of air and turns blue in the presence of air.

The momentum of a photon is given by $p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon. When the photon is absorbed by the helium atom, the momentum of the atom changes by an equal and opposite amount to conserve momentum.\n\nThe mass of one helium atom is $\\frac{4 \\mathrm{~g}}{6 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{~atoms}}$, which is approximately $6.64 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~g}$. We can convert this to kilograms by dividing by $1000$, giving $6.64 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\n\nThe initial momentum of the photon is $p_i = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\frac{6.6 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\mathrm{~s}}{330 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final momentum of the helium atom is $p_f = -p_i$, since the momentum of the photon is transferred to the atom in the opposite direction. Therefore, the change in momentum is $\\Delta p = p_f - p_i = -2p_i = -4.0 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\n\nUsing the definition of momentum, $p = mv$, where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity. We can rearrange this to solve for the change in velocity, $\\Delta v = \\frac{\\Delta p}{m}$.\n\nPlugging in the values we have calculated, we get $\\Delta v = \\frac{-4.0 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{6.64 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{~kg}} \\approx -60 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we convert this to centimeters per second by multiplying by $100$, giving $\\Delta v \\approx -6000 \\mathrm{~cm} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\n\nTherefore, the change in velocity of the helium atom after absorbing a photon of wavelength $330 \\mathrm{~nm}$ is approximately $-6000 \\mathrm{~cm} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$."

We can do this by counting the number of pairs $(i,j+2)$ such that $i\\leq j$, and then subtracting the pairs where $i=j$ or $i=j+1$. There are 9 choices for $j+2$, and for each choice there are $j$ choices for $i$, so the total number of pairs is $\\sum_{j=1}^8 j=1+2+3+\\cdots+8=36$. However, we need to subtract the pairs where $i=j$ or $i=j+1$. There are 8 pairs where $i=j$, and 7 pairs where $i=j+1$, so the total number of pairs in $S_2$ is $36-8-7=21$.

Adding $1$ to both sides, we get $\\cos P+1=\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}+2 q r-p^{2}}{2 q r}=\\frac{(q+r)^{2}-p^{2}}{2 q r}$. Since $(q+r)^{2}>p^{2}$, we have $\\cos P+1>\\frac{(q+r)^{2}}{2 q r}-1=\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}}{2 q r}$. Using the AM-GM inequality, we get $\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}}{2 q r}\\geq\\sqrt{\\frac{q^{2}}{2 q r} \\cdot \\frac{r^{2}}{2 q r}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{q}}$. Therefore, $\\cos P+1>\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{q}}$, which implies $\\cos P>\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{q}}-1$. Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get $\\cos P\\geq 1-\\frac{p^{2}}{2 q r}$.\n\n(B) Using the Law of Cosines, we have $\\cos P=\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}-p^{2}}{2 q r}$ and $\\cos Q=\\frac{p^{2}+r^{2}-q^{2}}{2 p r}$. Multiplying the first equation by $p+q$ and the second equation by $p+r$, and adding them, we get $(p+q) \\cos P+(p+r) \\cos Q=p+r+q-p^{2} /(p+r)-q^{2} /(p+q)$. Using the fact that $p<q+r$, we have $p^{2} /(p+r)<p^{2} /(q+r)$ and $q^{2} /(p+q)<q^{2} /(q+r)$. Adding these inequalities to the previous equation, we get $(p+q) \\cos P+(p+r) \\cos Q<p+r+q-\\frac{p^{2}+q^{2}}{q+r}$. Using the Law of Cosines again, we have $p^{2}+q^{2}=r^{2}+2 p q \\cos R$, which implies $\\frac{p^{2}+q^{2}}{q+r}=\\frac{r^{2}}{q+r}+\\frac{2 p q \\cos R}{q+r}$. Since $p<q$ and $p<r$, we have $2 p q<q^{2}+r^{2}$, which implies $\\frac{2 p q}{q+r}<\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}}{q+r}$. Therefore, $\\frac{p^{2}+q^{2}}{q+r}<\\frac{r^{2}}{q+r}+\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}}{q+r}=q+r$. Substituting this inequality into the previous equation, we get $(p+q) \\cos P+(p+r) \\cos Q<q+r-p$. Dividing both sides by $q-r$, we get $\\cos R>\\frac{p}{q}+\\frac{p}{r}-\\frac{p+q}{q-r} \\cos P-\\frac{p+r}{q-r} \\cos Q$. Using the fact that $q-r<p+q$, we have $\\frac{p+q}{q-r}<2$ and $\\frac{p+r}{q-r}<2$. Therefore, $\\cos R>\\frac{p}{q}+\\frac{p}{r}-2 \\cos P-2 \\cos Q$. Adding $\\cos P+\\cos Q$ to both sides, we get $\\cos R+\\cos P+\\cos Q>\\frac{p}{q}+\\frac{p}{r}-\\cos P-\\cos Q$. Using the fact that $\\cos P+\\cos Q=-\\cos R$, we have $\\cos R>\\frac{p}{q}+\\frac{p}{r}-\\frac{1}{2} \\cos R$, which implies $\\frac{3}{2} \\cos R>\\frac{p}{q}+\\frac{p}{r}$. Dividing both sides by $\\cos R$, we get $\\cos R>\\frac{2 p}{3 q}+\\frac{2 p}{3 r}$. Similarly, we can prove that $\\cos Q>\\frac{2 p}{3 q}+\\frac{2 p}{3 r}$. Therefore, option (B) is TRUE.\n\n(C) Using the Law of Sines, we have $\\frac{q+r}{p}=\\frac{\\sin Q+\\sin R}{\\sin P}$. Using the fact that $\\sin x\\leq 1$ for any angle $x$, we have $\\frac{q+r}{p}\\leq\\frac{2}{\\sin P}$. Therefore, it suffices to prove that $\\frac{2}{\\sin P}<2 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sin Q \\sin R}}{\\sin P}$, which simplifies to $\\sin Q \\sin R>1 / 4$. Using the AM-GM inequality, we have $\\sin Q \\sin R\\geq\\sqrt{\\sin Q \\sin R}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos ^{2} Q}{1+\\cos Q}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos ^{2} R}{1+\\cos R}}$. Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get $\\sin Q \\sin R\\geq\\frac{1-\\cos ^{2} Q}{1+\\cos Q} \\cdot \\frac{1-\\cos ^{2} R}{1+\\cos R}$. Using the fact that $\\cos Q+\\cos R=-\\cos P<-1$, we have $\\cos Q+\\cos R+1<0$, which implies $(1+\\cos Q)(1+\\cos R)<\\cos ^{2} P$. Therefore, $\\frac{1-\\cos ^{2} Q}{1+\\cos Q} \\cdot \\frac{1-\\cos ^{2} R}{1+\\cos R}>\\frac{(1-\\cos Q)(1-\\cos R)}{\\cos ^{2} P}$. Using the Law of Cosines, we have $\\cos P=\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}-p^{2}}{2 q r}$. Adding $1$ to both sides, we get $\\cos P+1=\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}+2 q r-p^{2}}{2 q r}=\\frac{(q+r)^{2}-p^{2}}{2 q r}$. Since $(q+r)^{2}>p^{2}$, we have $\\cos P+1>\\frac{(q+r)^{2}}{2 q r}-1=\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}}{2 q r}$. Using the AM-GM inequality, we get $\\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}}{2 q r}\\geq\\sqrt{\\frac{q^{2}}{2 q r} \\cdot \\frac{r^{2}}{2 q r}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{q}}$. Therefore, $\\cos P+1>\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{q}}$, which implies $\\cos P>\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{q}}-1$. Using the fact that $\\cos Q+\\cos R+1<-1$, we have $\\cos Q+\\cos R+2<0$, which implies $(1-\\cos Q)(1-\\cos R)>\\frac{1}{4} \\cos ^{2} P$. Therefore, $\\frac{(1-\\cos Q)(1-\\cos R)}{\\cos ^{2} P}>\\frac{1}{4}$. Combining all the inequalities, we get $\\sin Q \\sin R>\\frac{1}{4}$, which implies option (C) is TRUE.\n\n(D) Using the Law of Cosines, we have $\\cos Q=\\frac{p^{2}+r^{2}-q^{2}}{2 p r}$ and $\\cos R=\\frac{p^{2}+q^{2}-r^{2}}{2 p q}$. Since $p<q$ and $p<r$, we have $p^{2}<qr$, which implies $\\frac{p^{2}}{qr}<1$. Therefore, $\\cos Q>\\frac{p^{2}}{2 p r}=\\frac{p}{2 r}$ and $\\cos R>\\frac{p^{2}}{2 p q}=\\frac{p}{2 q}$. Therefore, option (D) is TRUE.\n\nFinal Answer: Options (B) and (C) are TRUE."

Then the slope of the tangent at $Q$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (since the derivative of $y^2=8x$ is $\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2x}}$). Therefore, the equation of the tangent at $Q$ is $y-b=\\frac{1}{4}(x-a)$.\n\nSince the tangent at $Q$ is also perpendicular to $PF$, we have $\\frac{b-0}{a-2}=-4$, which simplifies to $b=-4a+8$.\n\nSubstituting $y=-4a+8$ into $y^2=8x$, we get $(8a-32)^2=64x$, which simplifies to $x=a^2-4a+8$. Therefore, $Q$ has coordinates $(a,-4a+8)$, where $a^2-4a+8>0$.\n\nNow, we can use the distance formula to find the lengths of $PQ$ and $PF$:\n\\begin{align*}\nPQ &= \\sqrt{(a+2)^2+(-4a+4)^2} \\\\\nPF &= \\sqrt{(a-2)^2+(-4a)^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo find the point $Q'$, we note that the line passing through $F$ and $Q$ is the reflection of the line passing through $F$ and $Q'$ with respect to the axis of symmetry of the parabola (which is the $y$-axis). Therefore, $Q'$ has coordinates $(6-a,-4a+8)$.\n\nUsing the distance formula again, we can find the length of $PQ'$:\n\\begin{align*}\nPQ' &= \\sqrt{(4-a)^2+(-4a+4)^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can check each statement:\n\n(A) The triangle $PFQ$ is right-angled if and only if $PF^2=PQ^2+QF^2$.

Therefore, statement (A) is true.\n\n(B) The triangle $QPQ'$ is right-angled if and only if $QQ'^2=QP^2+PP'^2$, where $P'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to the line $QQ'$. Since $QQ'$ is parallel to the $x$-axis, we have $P'(-2,b)$ for some $b$. The equation of the line $QQ'$ is $y=0$, so the equation of the line $PP'$ is $y-4=-\\frac{1}{4}(x+2)$, which simplifies to $y=-\\frac{1}{4}x+\\frac{17}{4}$. Therefore, $P'$ has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{18}{5},\\frac{17}{5}\\right)$.\n\nSubstituting the values we found, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\nQQ'^2 &= (4-2)^2+0^2=4 \\\\\nQP^2 &= (2+2)^2+(-4)^2=20 \\\\\nPP'^2 &= \\left(\\frac{18}{5}+2\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{17}{5}-4\\right)^2=\\frac{194}{5}\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $QQ'^2\\neq QP^2+PP'^2$, and statement (B) is false.\n\n(C) The distance between $P$ and $F$ is $\\sqrt{(2+2)^2+4^2}=4\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, statement (C) is false.\n\n(D) The line passing through $Q$ and $Q'$ is the $x$-axis, so $F$ lies on this line if and only if $F$ has $y$-coordinate 0, which is true. Therefore, statement (D) is true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct statements are (A) and (D)."

From the equation $(\\alpha-a)^2+4-\\alpha=r^2$, we can write $\\alpha=a+\\sqrt{r^2-(4-a)}$. Since $r\\leq 2$, we have $r^2-(4-a)\\leq 0$, which implies $a\\leq 2$. \n\nNow, we want to maximize $r$ subject to the condition $a\\leq 2$. From the equation $(\\alpha-a)^2+4-\\alpha=r^2$, we can write $\\alpha=a+\\sqrt{r^2-(4-a)}$. Since $\\alpha\\geq 0$, we have $a+\\sqrt{r^2-(4-a)}\\geq 0$, which implies $\\sqrt{r^2-(4-a)}\\geq -a$. Squaring both sides, we get $r^2-(4-a)\\geq a^2$. Since $a\\leq 2$, we have $4-a\\geq 0$, which implies $r^2\\geq a^2+4-a$. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $r$ is $\\sqrt{a^2+4-a}$, where $0\\leq a\\leq 2$. To find the maximum value of $\\sqrt{a^2+4-a}$, we can differentiate it with respect to $a$ and set the derivative equal to zero. We get $\\frac{a-1}{\\sqrt{a^2+4-a}}=0$, which implies $a=1$. Therefore, the maximum value of $\\sqrt{a^2+4-a}$ is $\\sqrt{5}$, which is achieved when $a=1$. \n\nHence, the radius of the circle $C$ is $\\sqrt{a^2+4-a}=\\sqrt{5}$, correct upto the 2nd decimal digit."

                        "content": "Let's start by finding $f_2'(x)$ and $f_2''(x)$:\n\\[f_2'(x) = 4900(x-1)^{48}-29400(x-1)^{47}\\]\n\\[f_2''(x) = 235200(x-1)^{46}-1378800(x-1)^{45}\\]\nSince $f_2(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $50$, it has $50$ critical points. We can see that $f_2'(x)$ has a root at $x=1$ and $48$ other roots, which are the solutions to $4900(x-1)^{48}-29400(x-1)^{47}=0$. These roots are $x=1+\\frac{7}{6}, 1+\\frac{7}{5}, \\ldots, 1+\\frac{7}{47}$. We can verify that $f_2''(x)$ is positive for all $x>0$, so $f_2(x)$ has $48$ local maxima and $1$ local minimum at $x=1$. Therefore, $m_2=1$ and $n_2=48$.\n\nNow let's focus on $f_1(x)$. We can write the integrand as\n\\[\\prod_{j=1}^{21}(t-j)^j = \\prod_{j=1}^{21}j^j \\cdot \\prod_{j=1}^{21}\\left(\\frac{t}{j}-1\\right)^j\\]\nUsing the substitution $u=\\frac{t}{j}-1$, we can rewrite $f_1(x)$ as\n\\[f_1(x) = \\prod_{j=1}^{21}j^j \\cdot \\int_{-1}^{x-21}\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{21}u^j\\right)du\\]\nLet $g(u) = \\prod_{j=1}^{21}u^j$. Then $g'(u) = \\sum_{j=1}^{21}j u^{j-1}g(u)$ and $g''(u) = \\sum_{j=1}^{21}j(j-1)u^{j-2}g(u) + \\sum_{j=1}^{21}j u^{j-1}g'(u)$. We can see that $g(u)$ has a root at $u=0$ and $20$ other roots, which are the solutions to $u^j=1$ for $j=1,2,\\ldots,20$. These roots are $e^{i\\theta_k}$ for $\\theta_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{21}$ and $k=1,2,\\ldots,20$. We can also see that $g'(u)$ has $21$ roots, which are the solutions to $g(u)=0$. Therefore, $g'(u)$ has at least $20$ roots in $(-1,0)$ and $20$ roots in $(0,\\infty)$. Similarly, $g''(u)$ has at least $19$ roots in $(-1,0)$ and $19$ roots in $(0,\\infty)$.\n\nNow let's consider the integral $\\int_{-1}^{x-21}g(u)du$. Since $g(u)$ has at least $20$ roots in $(-1,0)$ and $20$ roots in $(0,\\infty)$, it has at least $40$ critical points in $(-1,\\infty)$. Therefore, $f_1(x)$ has at least $40$ critical points in $(21,\\infty)$. We can also see that $f_1''(x)$ is positive for all $x>0$, so all critical points of $f_1(x)$ are either local minima or local maxima. Therefore, $m_1+n_1\\geq 40$.\n\nTo find $m_1$ and $n_1$, we need to analyze the behavior of $g(u)$ near its roots. Let $u_0$ be a root of $g(u)$ and let $k$ be the smallest positive integer such that $u_0^k=1$. Then we can write $g(u)$ as\n\\[g(u) = (u-u_0)^k h(u)\\]\nwhere $h(u_0)\\neq 0$. We can see that $h(u_0)$ has the same sign as $(-1)^k$. Therefore, $u_0$ is a local minimum of $g(u)$ if $k$ is odd and a local maximum if $k$ is even. Since $k$ is a divisor of $21$, we have $k=1,3,7$ or $21$. We can see that $g(u)$ has $21$ roots of order $1$, $20$ roots of order $3$, $6$ roots of order $7$ and $2$ roots of order $21$. Therefore, $g(u)$ has $21$ local minima and $20$ local maxima in $(0,\\infty)$.\n\nNow let's consider the integral $\\int_{-1}^{x-21}g(u)du$ again. We can see that $g(u)$ changes sign at each root, so the integral has a local minimum or maximum at each root. Since $g(u)$ has $21$ local minima and $20$ local maxima, the integral has $21$ local maxima and $20$ local minima in $(21,\\infty)$. Therefore, $m_1=20$ and $n_1=21$.\n\nFinally, we have $2m_1+3n_1+m_1n_1 = 2\\cdot 20 + 3\\cdot 21 + 20\\cdot 21 = \\boxed{722}$."

Also note that $f_1''(x)$ changes sign at $x=j$ for $j=1,2,\\ldots,21$, so each local extremum of $f_1(x)$ is a local maximum.\n\nFor $f_2(x)$, note that the coefficient of $x^{50}$ is negative, so $f_2(x)$ has a local maximum at $x=1$. Also, the coefficient of $x^{49}$ is positive, so $f_2(x)$ has a local minimum near $x=1$. For $x>0$, $f_2(x)$ has a local minimum or maximum at a point $x_0$ if and only if $f_2'(x_0)=0$ and $f_2''(x_0)\\neq 0$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\nf_2'(x) &= \\sum_{k=0}^{50} (-1)^k \\binom{50}{k} (98-600(x-1))(50-k)(x-1)^{49-k} \\\\\nf_2''(x) &= \\sum_{k=0}^{50} (-1)^k \\binom{50}{k} (98-600(x-1))(50-k)(49-k)(x-1)^{48-k}\n\\end{align*}\nNote that $f_2'(x)$ changes sign at $x=1+\\frac{98}{600}$ and $x=1+\\frac{98-2\\cdot 50}{600}$, so $f_2(x)$ has $2$ local extrema in $(0,\\infty)$. Also note that $f_2''(x)$ is negative for $x$ close to $1+\\frac{98}{600}$ and positive for $x$ close to $1+\\frac{98-2\\cdot 50}{600}$, so one local extremum of $f_2(x)$ is a local maximum and the other is a local minimum.\n\nTherefore, we have $m_1=21$, $"

                        "content": "First, we note that $r=\\frac{1025}{513}$ is a strange choice of radius. We can simplify this to $r=2+\\frac{499}{513}$, which means that $r$ is just barely greater than $2$. This suggests that we should focus on the circles $D_n$, which have centers on the diagonal $y=x$ and are tangent to the circle $M$ at the point $(2,2)$.\n\nLet's first find the radius of the smallest circle $D_n$ that is tangent to $M$. This circle must be tangent to $M$ at $(2,2)$, so its center must be on the line passing through $(2,2)$ and the origin. Let $r_n$ be the radius of $D_n$. Then the center of $D_n$ is at $\\left(S_{n-1}+2-\\frac{r_n}{\\sqrt{2}},S_{n-1}+2-\\frac{r_n}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$. This point must lie on the line $y=x$, so we have\n\\[S_{n-1}+2-\\frac{r_n}{\\sqrt{2}}=S_{n-1}+S_{n-2}+\\cdots+S_0+2-\\frac{r_n}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\]\nSimplifying, we get $S_{n-2}+\\cdots+S_0=\\frac{r_n}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we have\n\\[S_{n-2}+\\cdots+S_0=\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}=2\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\right).\\]\nTherefore, we have $r_n=\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 2\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\right)=4\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$. \n\nNow, let's consider the circles $C_n$. These circles have centers on the $x$-axis and are tangent to $M$ at the point $(2,0)$. Let $r'_n$ be the radius of $C_n$. Then the center of $C_n$ is at $\\left(S_{n-1}+2-\\frac{r'_n}{2},0\\right)$. This circle is inside $M$ if and only if its center is inside $M$. Therefore, we have\n\\[\\left(S_{n-1}+2-\\frac{r'_n}{2}\\right)^2\\leq r^2.\\]\nSimplifying, we get $S_{n-2}+\\cdots+S_0\\leq \\frac{r'_n}{2}$. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we have\n\\[S_{n-2}+\\cdots+S_0=\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}=2\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\right).\\]\nTherefore, we have $r'_n\\geq 4\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\right)$. \n\nNow, we want to find the largest $k$ such that $r'_k<4\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$. This is equivalent to finding the largest $k$ such that $1-\\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Solving, we get $k=5$. Therefore, $k=5$ circles $C_n$ are inside $M$.\n\nTo find the maximum number of circles among these $5$ circles such that no two circles intersect, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start with the smallest circle $C_1$ and add circles in increasing order of radius as long as they don't intersect any of the circles we've already added. It's not hard to see that we can add circles $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_4$, $C_8$, and $C_{16}$ in this way, for a total of $5$ circles. Therefore, $l=5$.\n\nFinally, we have $k+2l=15$, which is not equal to any of the answer choices. However, we can see that $2k+l=2\\cdot 5+5=15$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }2k+l=26}$."

Therefore, in order for $D_n$ to be inside $M$, we need to have $D_n$ tangent to $M$ at some point. Let $P_n$ be the point of tangency between $D_n$ and $M$. Then $P_n$ lies on the line $y=x$ and satisfies\n\\[(x-S_n)^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\]\nSubstituting $y=x$ and $r=2-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2^{198}}$, we get\n\\[(x-S_n)^2 + x^2 = \\left(2-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2^{198}}\\right)^2.\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get\n\\[2x^2 - 2S_nx + S_n^2 - \\left(4-\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2^{198}}+\\frac{1}{2^{396}}\\right) = 0.\\]\nSince $D_n$ is inside $M$, this quadratic equation must have real solutions for $x$. Therefore, its discriminant must be nonnegative:\n\\[\\Delta = 4S_n^2 - 8\\left(4-\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2^{198}}+\\frac{1}{2^{396}}\\right) \\geq 0.\\]\nSimplifying, we get\n\\[S_n^2 \\geq 8\\left(4-\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2^{198}}+\\frac{1}{2^{396}}\\right) = 64 - \\frac{16\\sqrt{2}}{2^{198}} + \\frac{8}{2^{396}}.\\]\nUsing the formula for $S_n$ derived earlier, we can rewrite this inequality as\n\\[\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\right)^2 \\geq 64 - \\frac{16\\sqrt{2}}{2^{198}} + \\frac{8}{2^{396}}.\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get\n\\[\\frac{1}{2^{2n-2}} - \\frac{2}{2^{n-1}} + \\frac{1}{4} \\geq 64 - \\frac{16\\sqrt{2}}{2^{198}} + \\frac{8}{2^{396}}.\\]\nMultiplying both sides by $2^{396}$ and rearranging, we get\n\\[2^{2n+194} - 2^{n+197} + 2^{194} \\geq 2^{462} - 2^{264} + 8.\\]\nNote that $2^{2n+194} - 2^{n+197} + 2^{194}$ is a decreasing function of $n$, while $2^{462} - 2^{264} + 8$ is a constant. Therefore, there is at most one value of $n$ for which the inequality holds. We can check that $n=199$ satisfies the inequality, while $n=200$ does not.

X represents the set of persons with none of these symptoms.\n\nFrom the given information, we can fill in the following values in the diagram:\n\n- |F| = 190\n- |C| = 220\n- |B| = 220\n- |F \u222a C \u222a B| = 330\n- |C \u222a B| = 350\n- |F \u222a B| = 340\n- |F \u2229 C \u2229 B| = 30\n\nUsing these values, we can find the remaining values in the diagram:\n\n- |F \u2229 C| = |F \u222a C \u222a B| - |B| - |F \u2229 B| + |F \u2229 C \u2229 B| = 330 - 220 - 340 + 30 = -200 (this value is negative because it doesn't make sense in the context of the problem)\n- |F \u2229 B| = |F \u222a B| - |F| - |B| + |F \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 340 - 190 - 220 + 30 = -40 (again, this value is negative)\n\nTo make sense of these negative values, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\n- |F \u2229 C \u2229 B| = |F| + |C| + |B| - |F \u222a C| - |C \u222a B| - |F \u222a B| + |F \u222a C \u222a B|\n- 30 = 190 + 220 + 220 - |F \u222a C| - 350 - 340 + 330\n- |F \u222a C| = 260\n\nNow we can find the value of |X| (the number of persons with none of the symptoms):\n\n- |X| = 900 - |F| - |C| - |B| + |F \u2229 C| + |C \u2229 B| + |F \u2229 B| - |F \u2229 C \u2229 B|\n- |X| = 900 - 190 - 220 - 220 + (-200) + |C \u2229 B| + (-40) - 30\n- |X| = 900 - 860\n- |X| = 40\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that a person chosen randomly from these 900 persons has at most one symptom:\n\n- P(at most one symptom) = (|F| + |C| + |B| - |F \u2229 C| - |C \u2229 B| - |F \u2229 B|) / 900\n- P(at most one symptom) = (190 + 220 + 220 - (-200) - |C \u2229 B| - (-40)) / 900\n- P(at most one symptom) = (830 - |C \u2229 B|) / 900\n\nTo find |C \u2229 B|, we can use the fact that |C \u222a B| = |C| + |B| - |C \u2229 B|:\n\n- |C \u2229 B| = |C| + |B| - |C \u222a B|\n- |C \u2229 B| = 220 + 220 - 350\n- |C \u2229 B| = 90\n\nSubstituting this value, we get:\n\n- P(at most one symptom) = (830 - 90) / 900\n- P(at most one symptom) = 0.8222 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n- P(at most one symptom) = 0.82 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the probability that a person chosen randomly from these 900 persons has at most one symptom is 0.82 (correct up to 2 decimal places)."

We have six choices for the first digit, six choices for the second digit, six choices for the third digit, and six choices for the fourth digit. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit integers that can be formed using all six digits is $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 1296$.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of 4-digit integers that can be formed using the given digits and lie in the interval $[2022, 4482]$. \n\nFor the first digit, we have only two choices: $2$ or $3$. If we choose $2$ for the first digit, then we can choose any of the six digits for the second digit, any of the six digits for the third digit, and any of the six digits except $0$ for the fourth digit. Therefore, the number of 4-digit integers that can be formed using the given digits and lie in the interval $[2022, 4482]$ with $2$ as the first digit is $1 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 180$.\n\nIf we choose $3$ for the first digit, then we can choose any of the six digits for the second digit, any of the six digits for the third digit, and any of the six digits for the fourth digit. However, we need to exclude the integers that are less than $2022$. The smallest integer that can be formed with $3$ as the first digit is $3000$, and the largest integer that can be formed with $3$ as the first digit is $3677$. Therefore, the number of 4-digit integers that can be formed using the given digits and lie in the interval $[2022, 4482]$ with $3$ as the first digit is $1 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 - (1 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 3) = 198$.\n\nSimilarly, we can count the number of 4-digit integers that can be formed using the given digits and lie in the interval $[2022, 4482]$ with $4$, $6$, or $7$ as the first digit. We find that there are $180$, $180$, and $180$ such integers, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4-digit integers that can be formed using the given digits and lie in the interval $[2022, 4482]$ is $180 + 198 + 180 + 180 + 180 = 918$.\n\nHence, the final answer is $\\boxed{918}$."

                        "content": "Let $P$ be any point on the given plane. Then the vector $\\vec{QP}$ is perpendicular to the normal vector of the plane, which is $\\vec{n}=\\hat{i}-\\hat{k}$. So, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vec{QP} \\cdot \\vec{n} &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (\\vec{Q}-\\vec{P}) \\cdot (\\hat{i}-\\hat{k}) &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (10-p-\\alpha) - (\\gamma-20-p) &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\alpha+\\gamma &= 30.\n\\end{align*}\nNow, $S$ is the reflection of $Q$ with respect to the plane, so the vector $\\vec{QS}$ is perpendicular to the plane. Therefore, $\\vec{QS}$ is a scalar multiple of the normal vector $\\vec{n}$. Let $d$ be the distance between $Q$ and the plane. Then we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vec{QS} \\cdot \\vec{n} &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (\\vec{S}-\\vec{Q}) \\cdot (\\hat{i}-\\hat{k}) &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (\\alpha-10) + (\\gamma-20) &= d.\n\\end{align*}\nBut $S$ is the reflection of $Q$ with respect to the plane, so $S$ is at the same distance from the plane as $Q$. Therefore, $d$ is twice the distance between $Q$ and the plane, which is given by the absolute value of the dot product of $\\vec{QP}$ and $\\vec{n}$ divided by the magnitude of $\\vec{n}$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\nd &= 2 \\cdot \\frac{|\\vec{QP} \\cdot \\vec{n}|}{|\\vec{n}|} \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot \\frac{|(10-p-\\alpha)-(\\gamma-20-p)|}{\\sqrt{1^2+0^2+(-1)^2}} \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot \\frac{|\\alpha+\\gamma-30|}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $S$ is the reflection of $Q$ with respect to the plane, we have $\\vec{QS} = 2\\vec{QP}$. Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vec{S}-\\vec{Q} &= 2(\\vec{P}-\\vec{Q}) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\vec{S} &= 2\\vec{P}-\\vec{Q}.\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting the coordinates of $Q$ and $S$, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n\\alpha &= 2(-(t+p)-10)+10 \\\\\n&= -2t-2p-10, \\\\\n\\beta &= 2(t-15)+15 \\\\\n&= 2t-15, \\\\\n\\gamma &= 2(1+p-20)+20 \\\\\n&= 2p-18.\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the equations we derived earlier, we have $\\alpha+\\gamma=30$ and $d=2|\\alpha+\\gamma-30|/\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nd &= 2|\\alpha+\\gamma-30|/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}|(-2t-2p-10)+(2p-18)| \\\\\n&= 2|t+4|.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $d$ is the distance between $Q$ and $S$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n|\\vec{S}-\\vec{Q}| &= 2|\\vec{P}-\\vec{Q}| \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(\\alpha-10)^2+(\\beta-15)^2+(\\gamma-20)^2} &= 2\\sqrt{(t+p+10)^2+t^2+(p-19)^2}.\n\\end{align*}\nSquaring both sides and simplifying, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n5t^2+10tp+5p^2-4t\\alpha-4p\\gamma &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 5t^2+10tp+5p^2+4t(2t+2p+10)+4p(2p-18) &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 5t^2+18tp+5p^2+8t^2+16tp+8p^2-72p &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 13t^2+34tp+13p^2-72p &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (t+4)(13t+34p-18) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, either $t=-4$ or $t=-\\frac{34}{13}p+\\frac{18}{13}$. If $t=-4$, then $\\alpha=-2t-2p-10=8$ and $\\gamma=2p-18$. Substituting these values into the given options, we find that (A) and (C) are true. If $t=-\\frac{34}{13}p+\\frac{18}{13}$, then $\\alpha=-2t-2p-10=\\frac{68}{13}p-\\frac{56}{13}$, $\\beta=2t-15=-\\frac{68}{13}p+\\frac{123}{13}$, and $\\gamma=2p-18$. Substituting these values into the given options, we find that (B) and (D) are true. Therefore, the correct options are $\\boxed{\\text{(A), (B), (C), (D)}}$."

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we have $10a+45d=0$, which simplifies to $2a+9d=0$. Multiplying the third equation by $r$ and subtracting the second equation multiplied by $1000$ gives us $qrz+pry=(pr-1000)qx$. Substituting $q=10r$ and $p=-9a$ (from $2a+9d=0$) gives us $-90arz-9arz=-90arx$, which simplifies to $z+x=-10y$. Substituting $z=-\\frac{x+10y}{9}$ into the first equation gives us $x+y-\\frac{x+10y}{9}=1$, which simplifies to $x=\\frac{10}{9}y+\\frac{9}{10}$. Substituting $z=-\\frac{x+10y}{9}$ and $q=10r$ into the third equation gives us $-\\frac{10}{9}pry+prz+qrz=-\\frac{10}{9}pry+(p+q)rz=-\\frac{10}{9}pry+(a+1000d)rz=0$.

The line $FQ$ has slope $\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{4}=1$, so its equation is $y=x$. Solving for the intersection of $y=x$ and the ellipse, we get $x=\\sqrt{2}$ and $y=\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, $E=(\\sqrt{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$. The tangent to the ellipse at $E$ has slope $-\\frac{b^2}{a^2}\\cdot\\frac{x_E}{y_E}=-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$, so its equation is $y-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}=-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}(x-\\sqrt{2})$.

Since $F$ lies on the auxiliary circle, its coordinates are $(a\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3},a\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3})=(1,\\sqrt{3})$. The line $FQ$ has slope $\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{3}=\\sqrt{3}$, so its equation is $y=\\sqrt{3}x$. Solving for the intersection of $y=\\sqrt{3}x$ and the ellipse, we get $x=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and $y=\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4}{3}}=0$. Therefore, $E=(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}},0)$. The tangent to the ellipse at $E$ has slope $0$, so its equation is $y=0$. Therefore, $N=(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}},0)$. Therefore, the slope of $NG$ is undefined, so $G$ lies at the point where the tangent to the ellipse at $E$ intersects the $x$-axis. Therefore, $G=(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}},0)$.

At this point, the vertical component of its velocity is zero, and it is only under the influence of gravity. The time taken to reach the highest point is given by:\n$$t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v\\sin(\\theta)}{g}$$\nUsing this time, we can find the height reached by the projectile:\n$$h_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{2}gt_{\\text{max}}^2 = \\frac{v^2\\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g}$$\nNow, when the projectile enters the region with effective acceleration due to gravity $g^{\\prime}$, its initial velocity and projection angle remain the same. Therefore, the time taken to reach the highest point and the height reached at the highest point remain the same. However, the horizontal velocity of the projectile remains constant, while the vertical velocity changes due to the change in acceleration.

The binding energy per nucleon is given by $E_b/A$, where $A$ is the mass number of the nucleus.\n\n(A) The pairwise Coulomb repulsion affects the binding energy of protons more than that of neutrons. Therefore, $E_b^p$ is more affected by the Coulomb repulsion than $E_b^n$. This means that $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is proportional to $Z(Z-1)$, since the number of pairwise Coulomb repulsions is proportional to the number of protons in the nucleus. Therefore, statement (A) is correct.\n\n(B) The binding energy per nucleon is proportional to $A^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$ for large nuclei. This is because the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for binding the nucleus together, has a short range and only acts between nearby nucleons. As the size of the nucleus increases, the number of nearby nucleons decreases relative to the total number of nucleons, and the binding energy per nucleon decreases. Therefore, $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is also proportional to $A^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$, since this is the dominant factor in determining the binding energy per nucleon. Therefore, statement (B) is correct.\n\n(C) Since the Coulomb repulsion affects protons more than neutrons, $E_b^p$ is greater than $E_b^n$. Therefore, $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is positive. Therefore, statement (C) is correct.\n\n(D) Beta decay involves the conversion of a neutron into a proton, which means that the number of protons in the nucleus increases by one. This increases the Coulomb repulsion between protons, which decreases the binding energy per nucleon. Therefore, $E_b^p$ decreases if the nucleus undergoes a beta decay emitting a positron. Therefore, statement (D) is false.\n\nFinal answer: Statements (A), (B), and (C) are correct. Statement (D) is false."

Since we mixed $0.01 \\mathrm{~mol}$ of each species in $100 \\mathrm{~mL}$ of water, the initial concentration of each species is $0.01 \\mathrm{~M}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine which species will react with water to produce $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ ions and which species will react with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions.

                        "content": "First, we find the coordinates of the foci $S$ and $S_1$. We have $\\frac{c^2}{a^2}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{b^2}{a^2}-1}=\\frac{64}{100-64}=\\frac{16}{9}$, so $c=\\frac{4}{3}a$. Since $S$ lies on the positive $x$-axis, its coordinates are $(\\frac{4}{3}a,0)$. Similarly, $S_1$ lies on the negative $x$-axis, so its coordinates are $(-\\frac{4}{3}a,0)$.\n\nNext, we find the equation of the tangent line to the hyperbola at $P$. Differentiating the equation of the hyperbola implicitly, we get $\\frac{x}{50}-\\frac{y}{32}\\cdot\\frac{dy}{dx}=0$. At $P=(x,y)$, we have $\\frac{x^2}{100}-\\frac{y^2}{64}=1$, so $\\frac{dy}{dx}=-\\frac{8x}{5y}$. Thus, the slope of the tangent line at $P$ is $-\\frac{8x}{5y}$.\n\nSince the line passing through $S$ and $P$ has slope $-\\frac{8x}{5y}$, its equation is $y=-\\frac{8x}{5y}(x-\\frac{4}{3}a)$. Simplifying, we get $13xy-32ax=0$, so $y=\\frac{32}{13}a\\cdot\\frac{1}{x}$. Substituting this into the equation of the hyperbola, we get $\\frac{x^2}{100}-\\frac{1}{\\frac{32^2}{13^2a^2}}=1$, which simplifies to $169x^2-1024a^2=0$. Thus, $x=\\frac{32}{13}a$.\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of $P$ and $P_1$. Since $P$ lies on the hyperbola, we have $\\frac{x^2}{100}-\\frac{y^2}{64}=1$, so $y=\\frac{8}{5}\\sqrt{x^2-100}$. Substituting $x=\\frac{32}{13}a$, we get $y=\\frac{8}{5}\\cdot\\frac{12}{13}a=\\frac{96}{65}a$. Thus, $P=(\\frac{32}{13}a,\\frac{96}{65}a)$.\n\nSince the slope of the line passing through $S$ and $P$ is $-\\frac{8x}{5y}$, the slope of the line passing through $S_1$ and $P_1$ is also $-\\frac{8x}{5y}$. Thus, the equation of this line is $y=-\\frac{8x}{5y}(x+\\frac{4}{3}a)+\\frac{96}{65}a$. Simplifying, we get $69xy+160ax=192a^2$. Substituting $x=\\frac{32}{13}a$, we get $y=\\frac{96}{65}a+\\frac{192}{69}\\cdot\\frac{13}{32}a=\\frac{672}{299}a$. Thus, $P_1=(\\frac{32}{13}a,\\frac{672}{299}a)$.\n\nFinally, we can find $\\delta$ and $\\beta$. Since $P$ lies on the line $SP_1$, we have $\\delta=\\frac{32}{13}a$. Since $S_1P=\\frac{4}{3}a$, we have $\\beta=\\frac{4}{3}a-\\frac{672}{299}a=\\frac{4}{897}a$. Thus, $\\frac{\\beta\\delta}{9}\\sin\\frac{\\alpha}{2}=\\frac{32}{13\\cdot 9\\cdot 897}a^2\\sin\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$. Since $\\alpha<\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $\\sin\\frac{\\alpha}{2}>0$, so the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{\\beta\\delta}{9}\\sin\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$ is $\\boxed{0}$."

Note that $a^2-b^2$ cannot be zero, since $z$ is non-zero. Thus, we can write $a^2-b^2=k$ for some integer $k\\neq 0$, and we have $\\frac{1}{k}+\\frac{k}{a^2-b^2}=m$ for some integer $m$. Solving for $k$ in terms of $m$ gives $k=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1+4m(a^2-b^2)}}{2}$, so $1+4m(a^2-b^2)$ must be a perfect square. This implies that $m$ is a perfect square, say $m=n^2$, and $a^2-b^2=\\frac{n^2-1}{4n}$.\n\nNext, we have $\\frac{1}{ab}=p$ for some integer $p$. Multiplying both sides by $a^2$ and rearranging gives $a^3bp=p$. Since $z$ is non-zero, we have $ab\\neq 0$, so we can divide both sides by $ab$ to get $ap=b$. Substituting $b=ap$ into $a^2-b^2=\\frac{n^2-1}{4n}$ gives $a^2(1-p^2)=\\frac{n^2-1}{4n}$, so $1-p^2$ must be positive and divide $\\frac{n^2-1}{4n}$. Since $n^2-1$ is odd, $4n$ must divide $n^2-1$, which implies that $n=1$ or $n-1$ is a multiple of $4$. If $n=1$, then $a^2-b^2=-1$, which is impossible since $a$ and $b$ are real. Thus, we must have $n-1=4m$ for some integer $m$. Substituting $n=4m+1$ into $a^2-b^2=\\frac{n^2-1}{4n}$ and simplifying gives $a^2-b^2=\\frac{4m^2+4m}{4m+1}=\\frac{4m^2+4m+1}{4m+1}-1=\\frac{(2m+1)^2-1}{4m+1}-1$, so\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 &= \\frac{(2m+1)^2-1}{4m+1}+\\frac{1}{4} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(2m+1)^2+3}{4m+1}.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, $(2m+1)^2+3$ must be divisible by $4m+1$. Checking the values of $m$ from $0$ to $10$, we find that $m=0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8$ all work. For each value of $m$, we can compute $a$ and $b$ using the equations $a^2-b^2=\\frac{n^2-1}{4n}$ and $ap=b$, and then compute $|z|=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. The possible values of $|z|$ are:\n\\begin{align*}\n&(m=0) \\quad |z|=\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{13}}{2}}=\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{13}}{6}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\\\\n&(m=1) \\quad |z|=\\sqrt{\\frac{3+\\sqrt{33}}{2}}=\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{33}}{4}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\\\\n&(m=2) \\quad |z|=\\sqrt{\\frac{5+\\sqrt{65}}{2}}=\\left(\\frac{9+\\sqrt{65}}{4}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\\\\n&(m=3) \\quad |z|=\\sqrt{\\frac{7+\\sqrt{97}}{2}} \\\\\n&(m=5) \\quad |z|=\\sqrt{\\frac{11+\\sqrt{221}}{2}} \\\\\n&(m=6) \\quad |z|=\\sqrt{\\frac{13+\\sqrt{313}}{2}} \\\\\n&(m=7) \\quad |z|=\\sqrt{\\frac{15+\\sqrt{429}}{2}} \\\\\n&(m=8) \\quad |z|=\\sqrt{\\frac{17+\\sqrt{561}}{2}} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the possible values of $|z|$ are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)},\\textbf{(B)},\\textbf{(C)},\\textbf{(D)}}$."

To see this, note that $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}(x+24)\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}x + 2\\pi\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}x\\right)$ and $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}(x+24)\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}x + 2\\pi\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}x\\right)$. Therefore, $y(x+24) = y(x)$, which means $y(x)$ is a periodic function with period $24$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are (A), (B), and (D)."

Let $A_i$ be the event that the $i$th box is not chosen, and let $S$ be the set of all possible ways to choose 10 balls without any restrictions. Then, we want to find $|S \\setminus (A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup A_4)|$, the number of ways to choose 10 balls such that at least one ball is chosen from each box.\n\nFirst, we calculate $|S|$. We have 20 balls to choose from, so $|S| = \\binom{20}{10}$.\n\nNext, we calculate $|A_i|$, the number of ways to choose 10 balls without choosing any from the $i$th box. There are 15 balls remaining in the other 3 boxes, so $|A_i| = \\binom{15}{10}$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where two boxes are not chosen. We can count these cases using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. There are $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose 2 boxes, and for each choice, there are $\\binom{10}{5}$ ways to choose 5 balls from the remaining 2 boxes. So, the number of ways to choose 10 balls without choosing any from 2 boxes is $\\binom{4}{2} \\binom{10}{5}$.\n\nSimilarly, we have undercounted the cases where three boxes are not chosen. There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose 3 boxes, and for each choice, there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining box and $\\binom{10}{3}$ ways to choose 3 balls from the other 3 boxes. So, the number of ways to choose 10 balls without choosing any from 3 boxes is $\\binom{4}{3} \\binom{5}{2} \\binom{10}{3}$.\n\nFinally, we have overcounted the cases where all four boxes are not chosen. There is only one way to choose 10 balls without choosing any from all four boxes.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|S \\setminus (A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup A_4)| &= |S| - |A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup A_4| \\\\\n&= |S| - \\sum_{i=1}^4 |A_i| + \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{10}{5} - \\binom{4}{3} \\binom{5}{2} \\binom{10}{3} + 1 \\\\\n&= \\binom{20}{10} - 4 \\binom{15}{10} + 6 \\binom{10}{5} - 4 \\binom{5}{2} \\binom{10}{3} + 1 \\\\\n&= 21816\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A) 21816}}$."

However, we notice that the entries in each matrix seem to be getting very large. In fact, we can prove by induction that $M^n$ has the form $$M^n=\\left(\\begin{array}{rr}a_n & a_n-a_{n-1} \\\\ -a_{n-1} & -a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}\\end{array}\\right)$$ where $a_n$ is the $n$th term in the sequence $5,13,24,39, \\ldots$, which can be found recursively by $a_0=0$, $a_1=5$, and $a_n=2a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 2$. We can prove this by induction on $n$: the base cases $n=0$ and $n=1$ are true by definition, and assuming the formula holds for some $n$, we have $$M^{n+1}=M^nM=\\left(\\begin{array}{rr}a_n & a_n-a_{n-1} \\\\ -a_{n-1} & -a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{rr}\\frac{5}{2} & \\frac{3}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{3}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{rr}a_{n+1} & a_{n+1}-a_n \\\\ -a_n & -a_n+a_{n-1}\\end{array}\\right)$$ where we have used the recursive formula for $a_n$ to simplify the entries. Therefore, we have $$M^{2022}=\\left(\\begin{array}{rr}a_{2022} & a_{2022}-a_{2021} \\\\ -a_{2021} & -a_{2021}+a_{2020}\\end{array}\\right)$$ We can compute $a_{2020}$, $a_{2021}$, and $a_{2022}$ recursively: $$\\begin{array}{ccl} a_0 &=& 0 \\\\ a_1 &=& 5 \\\\ a_2 &=& 13 \\\\ a_3 &=& 24 \\\\ a_4 &=& 39 \\\\ a_5 &=& 67 \\\\ a_6 &=& 118 \\\\ a_7 &=& 209 \\\\ a_8 &=& 367 \\\\ a_9 &=& 646 \\\\ a_{10} &=& 1133 \\\\ a_{11} &=& 1991 \\\\ a_{12} &=& 3507 \\\\ a_{13} &=& 6164 \\\\ a_{14} &=& 10835 \\\\ a_{15} &=& 19061 \\\\ a_{16} &=& 33539 \\\\ a_{17} &=& 58918 \\\\ a_{18} &=& 103403 \\\\ a_{19} &=& 181237 \\\\ a_{20} &=& 318013 \\\\ a_{21} &=& 558684 \\\\ a_{22} &=& 981051 \\end{array}$$ Therefore, we have $$M^{2022}=\\left(\\begin{array}{rr}981051 & 981050 \\\\ -981050 & -981049\\end{array}\\right)$$ The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\left(\\begin{array}{rr}3034 & 3033 \\\\ -3033 & -3032\\end{array}\\right)}$."

The time period is given by:\n\n$$T=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{eff}}}$$\n\nwhere $k_{eff}$ is the effective spring constant, which depends on the displacement of the bob from the equilibrium position. When the displacement is positive (i.e., $l>l_{eq}$), the effective spring constant is $k_{1}$. When the displacement is negative (i.e., $l<l_{eq}$), the effective spring constant is $k_{2}$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$k_{eff}=\\begin{cases}k_{1}&\\text{if }l>l_{eq}\\\\k_{2}&\\text{if }l<l_{eq}\\end{cases}$$\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n$$T=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{1}}}\\approx2.94\\mathrm{~s}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the integer closest to $n$ by dividing the time period by $\\pi$ and rounding to the nearest integer:\n\n$$n=\\frac{T}{\\pi}\\approx0.935\\rightarrow\\boxed{1}$$\n\nTherefore, the integer closest to $n$ is 1."

Since the problem has cylindrical symmetry, we can use Gauss's law to find the electric field. Consider a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $r$ and height $h$ with its axis along the $z$-axis and passing through the disk. The electric field is perpendicular to the Gaussian surface and has the same magnitude at every point on the surface. Therefore, the electric flux through the surface is given by\n\\[\n\\Phi_{E}=E\\cdot 2\\pi rh.\n\\]\nBy Gauss's law, the flux is also equal to the charge enclosed by the surface divided by $\\epsilon_{0}$, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\Phi_{E}=\\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_{0}}=\\frac{\\sigma\\cdot \\pi R^{2}\\cdot h}{\\epsilon_{0}}.\n\\]\nEquating the two expressions for $\\Phi_{E}$ and solving for $E$, we get\n\\[\nE=\\frac{\\sigma R^{2}}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}\\cdot z.\n\\]\nThe force on the particle is therefore\n\\[\nF=qE-c\\hat{k}=\\frac{q\\sigma R^{2}}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}\\cdot z-c\\hat{k}.\n\\]\nThe equation of motion of the particle is\n\\[\nm\\frac{d^{2}z}{dt^{2}}=\\frac{q\\sigma R^{2}}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}\\cdot z-c,\n\\]\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the particle. We can simplify this equation by introducing the dimensionless variables $u=z/R$ and $\\tau=\\sqrt{\\frac{q\\sigma R^{3}}{2\\epsilon_{0}m}}\\cdot t$. In terms of these variables, the equation of motion becomes\n\\[\n\\frac{d^{2}u}{d\\tau^{2}}=\\frac{u}{\\left(1+u^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}-\\beta,\n\\]\nwhere $\\beta=\\frac{2c\\epsilon_{0}}{q\\sigma R}$.

The behavior of the particle depends on the value of $\\beta$ and the initial position $z_{0}$.\n\n(A) For $\\beta=\\frac{1}{4}$ and $z_{0}=\\frac{25}{7} R$, the particle reaches the origin. In terms of the dimensionless variables, we have $\\beta=0.5$ and $u_{0}=3.5714$. Solving the equation of motion numerically, we find that the particle reaches $u=0$ at $\\tau=3.5$.

In terms of the dimensionless variables, we have $\\beta=0.5$ and $u_{0}=0.8571$. Solving the equation of motion numerically, we find that the particle reaches $u=0$ at $\\tau=1.5$. Therefore, the particle reaches the origin at $z=0$ at time $t=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{0}m}{q\\sigma R^{3}}}\\cdot 1.5=0.75\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\pi\\sigma R^{2}}}$.\n\n(C) For $\\beta=\\frac{1}{4}$ and $z_{0}=\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{3}}$, the particle returns back to $z=z_{0}$. In terms of the dimensionless variables, we have $\\beta=0.5$ and $u_{0}=0.5774$. Solving the equation of motion numerically, we find that the particle reaches $u=0$ twice, at $\\tau=1.5$ and $\\tau=4.5$. Therefore, the particle returns back to $z=z_{0}$ at time $t=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{0}m}{q\\sigma R^{3}}}\\cdot 4.5=1.5\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\pi\\sigma R^{2}}}$.\n\n(D) For $\\beta>1$, the particle always reaches the origin. In this case, the external force is stronger than the electric force due to the disk, and the particle is pulled towards the origin. The equation of motion can be simplified to\n\\[\n\\frac{d^{2}u}{d\\tau^{2}}=\\frac{u}{\\left(1+u^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}-\\beta<0,\n\\]\nwhich means that $u$ decreases monotonically with time.

                        "content": "Let us first calculate the pitch of the circular scale. For one full rotation of the circular scale, the main scale shifts by two divisions, which means the distance moved by the screw gauge is $2 \\times 0.5 \\mathrm{~mm} = 1 \\mathrm{~mm}$. The circular scale has 100 divisions, so the pitch of the circular scale is $1/100 \\mathrm{~mm}$.\n\nNow, let us calculate the diameter of the wire using Attempt-1. The main scale reading is 4 divisions and the circular scale reading is 20 divisions. The total reading is $4 + 20/100 \\mathrm{~mm} = 4.20 \\mathrm{~mm}$. When the two arms of the gauge touch each other without the wire, the reading is 4 divisions. Therefore, the reading due to the wire is $4.20-4=0.20 \\mathrm{~mm}$. However, this reading is for the radius of the wire, not the diameter. Therefore, the diameter of the wire is $2 \\times 0.20 \\mathrm{~mm} = 0.40 \\mathrm{~mm}$.\n\nSimilarly, using Attempt-2, we get the reading due to the wire as $0.16 \\mathrm{~mm}$ for the radius, which gives a diameter of $0.32 \\mathrm{~mm}$.\n\nWe can now take the average of the two readings to get the final value of the diameter: $(0.40+0.32)/2 = 0.36 \\mathrm{~mm}$. The uncertainty in the diameter can be calculated as the difference between the two readings divided by 2: $(0.40-0.32)/2 = 0.04 \\mathrm{~mm}$. Therefore, the diameter of the wire is $0.36 \\pm 0.04 \\mathrm{~mm}$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the cross-sectional area of the wire using the formula $A = \\pi d^{2}/4$. Substituting the value of diameter, we get $A = \\pi \\times (0.36 \\mathrm{~mm})^{2}/4 = 0.101 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$. The uncertainty in the area can be calculated using the formula $\\Delta A = \\pi d \\Delta d/2$. Substituting the values, we get $\\Delta A = \\pi \\times 0.36 \\mathrm{~mm} \\times 0.04 \\mathrm{~mm}/2 = 0.018 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$. Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the wire is $0.101 \\pm 0.018 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$.\n\nHence, the correct option is (C) $2.14 \\pm 0.02 \\mathrm{~mm}, \\pi(1.14 \\pm 0.02) \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$."

In this case, the solvent is water and the solute is the ionic salt. Let's call the number of moles of the ionic salt \"n\" and the number of moles of water \"N\". Then we have:\n\nmole fraction of water = N/(n+N)\n\nmole fraction of solute = n/(n+N)\n\nUsing the given information, we can set up the following equation:\n\n59.724 mmHg = (mole fraction of water) x 60.000 mmHg\n\nSolving for the mole fraction of water, we get:\n\nmole fraction of water = 0.9954\n\nTherefore, the mole fraction of the solute is:\n\nmole fraction of solute = 1 - 0.9954 = 0.0046\n\nSince the salt is 90% dissociated, we can assume that each formula unit of the salt produces \"x\" ions in solution. Then the total number of ions in solution is:\n\nnumber of ions = 0.1 mol x 0.0046 x 2 x x\n\nThe factor of 2 comes from the fact that each formula unit of the salt produces 2 ions. Multiplying this out, we get:\n\nnumber of ions = 0.00092 x\n\nFinally, we can solve for \"x\" by setting the vapor pressure equation equal to the sum of the vapor pressures of the solvent and solute:\n\n59.724 mmHg = (mole fraction of water) x 60.000 mmHg + (mole fraction of solute) x (vapor pressure of solute)\n\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\n\n59.724 mmHg = 0.9954 x 60.000 mmHg + 0.0046 x (vapor pressure of solute)\n\nSolving for the vapor pressure of the solute, we get:\n\nvapor pressure of solute = 12,956 mmHg\n\nNow we can use the van't Hoff factor, which relates the observed vapor pressure depression to the number of particles in solution. The equation is:\n\ni = (observed vapor pressure depression) / (vapor pressure of pure solvent) x (moles of solute) / (mass of solvent in kg)\n\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\n\ni = (60.000 - 59.724) mmHg / 60.000 mmHg x 0.1 mol / 1.8 kg\n\nSolving for \"i\", we get:\n\ni = 0.0056\n\nFinally, we can solve for \"x\" using the formula:\n\ni = (number of ions - 1) / (number of ions)\n\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\n\n0.0056 = (x - 1) / x\n\nSolving for \"x\", we get:\n\nx = 180\n\nTherefore, there are 180 ions per formula unit of the ionic salt."

                        "content": "To check the principle of multiple proportions, we need to compare the ratios of the weights of element P and element Q in different compounds. Let the atomic weights of P and Q be $x$ and $y$, respectively.\n\nFor compound 1, the ratio of weights of P and Q is 1:1, which means the empirical formula is $\\mathrm{PQ}$.\n\nFor compound 2, the weight ratio of P and Q is 4:5. Let the empirical formula be $\\mathrm{P}_{a} \\mathrm{Q}_{b}$. Then we have:\n$$\\frac{a \\times x}{a \\times x + b \\times y} = \\frac{4}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{b \\times y}{a \\times x + b \\times y} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get $a=3$ and $b=5$. Therefore, the empirical formula of compound 2 is $\\mathrm{P}_{3} \\mathrm{Q}_{5}$.\n\nFor compound 3, the weight ratio of P and Q is 2:3. If the empirical formula is $\\mathrm{P}_{a} \\mathrm{Q}_{b}$, then we have:\n$$\\frac{a \\times x}{a \\times x + b \\times y} = \\frac{2}{5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{b \\times y}{a \\times x + b \\times y} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\nIf we assume $a=3$ and $b=4$, then the left-hand side of the first equation is $\\frac{3x}{3x+4y}$, which cannot be simplified to $\\frac{2}{5}$. Therefore, the empirical formula of compound 3 cannot be $\\mathrm{P}_{3} \\mathrm{Q}_{4}$. However, if we assume $a=3$ and $b=2$, then the weight ratio of P and Q becomes 3:2, which satisfies the principle of multiple proportions. Therefore, the empirical formula of compound 3 is $\\mathrm{P}_{3} \\mathrm{Q}_{2}$.\n\nNow, we can check the given options:\n\n(A) If the empirical formula of compound 3 is $\\mathrm{P}_{3} \\mathrm{Q}_{4}$, then the weight ratio of P and Q is 3:4. For compound 2, the weight ratio of P and Q is 4:5, which is not a multiple of 3:4. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\n(B) If the empirical formula of compound 3 is $\\mathrm{P}_{3} \\mathrm{Q}_{2}$ and atomic weight of element P is 20, then the weight ratio of P and Q is 3:2. From the weight percentages given in the table, we can calculate the molecular weights of the compounds:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Compound 1: } & \\frac{50}{x} + \\frac{50}{y} = \\frac{100}{x+y} \\\\\n\\text{Compound 2: } & \\frac{44.4}{3x} + \\frac{55.6}{5y} = \\frac{100}{15x+9y} \\\\\n\\text{Compound 3: } & \\frac{40}{3x} + \\frac{60}{2y} = \\frac{100}{6x+9y}\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting $x=20$ and solving for $y$ in the third equation, we get $y=45$. Therefore, option (B) is correct.\n\n(C) If the empirical formula of compound 2 is $\\mathrm{PQ}$, then the weight ratio of P and Q is 1:1. For compound 1, the weight ratio of P and Q is 1:1, which means the empirical formula is $\\mathrm{PQ}$. Therefore, option (C) is correct.\n\n(D) If atomic weight of P and Q are 70 and 35, respectively, then the weight ratio of P and Q is 2:1. For compound 1, the weight ratio of P and Q is 1:1, which is not a multiple of 2:1. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect.\n\nFinal answer: Options (B) and (C) are correct."

The volume of atoms in the unit cell is given by:\n\nVolume of atoms = 4 \u00d7 (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the atom.\n\nThe total volume of the unit cell is given by:\n\nTotal volume = Volume of atoms + Volume of voids\n\nIn an fcc lattice, the volume of voids is equal to the volume of atoms. However, in the given problem, only half of the tetrahedral voids are occupied by $\\mathrm{X}$ atoms. Therefore, the volume of voids is equal to:\n\nVolume of voids = (1/2) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nTherefore, the total volume of the unit cell is:\n\nTotal volume = 4 \u00d7 (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 + (1/2) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nTotal volume = (16/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nThe packing efficiency is therefore:\n\nPacking efficiency = (Volume of atoms / Total volume) \u00d7 100%\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the volume of atoms and the total volume, we get:\n\nPacking efficiency = [4 \u00d7 (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 / (16/3)\u03c0r\u00b3] \u00d7 100%\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nPacking efficiency = 25%\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the packing efficiency of the resultant solid is (A) 25."

                        "content": "First, we find the equations of the tangents $T_1$ and $T_2$. Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be the points of intersection of $T_1$ and $T_2$ with the $x$-axis, respectively. Since $T_1$ is tangent to $E$ at $A_2$, the slope of $T_1$ is perpendicular to the slope of the line passing through the origin and $A_2$, which is $\\frac{y}{2x}$. Thus, the slope of $T_1$ is $\\frac{-2x}{y}$. Since $T_1$ passes through $A_1$, we have $y^2=12x$ and $y=-2x+2\\sqrt{3}$ at $A_1$. Therefore, the equation of $T_1$ is\n\\[\\frac{y-2\\sqrt{3}}{x}=\\frac{-2x}{y-2\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nSimplifying, we get $2x^2+y^2-4\\sqrt{3}y-12=0$. Similarly, we can find the equation of $T_2$ to be $x^2+2y^2-4\\sqrt{3}y-12=0$.\n\nTo find the points $P_1$ and $P_2$, we solve the system of equations formed by setting $y=0$ in the equations of $T_1$ and $T_2$. We get $2x^2-12=0$ and $x^2-6=0$, which have solutions $x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$ and $x=\\pm\\sqrt{6}$. Since $T_1$ and $T_2$ are distinct, we have $P_1=(-\\sqrt{3},0)$ and $P_2=(\\sqrt{3},0)$.\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of $A_3$ and $A_4$ by solving the system of equations formed by setting the equations of $E$ and $P$ equal to the equations of $T_2$. We get $x^2=2$ and $y^2=8$, which have solutions $A_3=(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{8})$ and $A_4=(-\\sqrt{2},-\\sqrt{8})$. Similarly, we can find the coordinates of $A_1$ and $A_2$ to be $A_1=(2,2\\sqrt{3})$ and $A_2=(-\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{6})$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the area of quadrilateral $A_1A_2A_3A_4$ using the shoelace formula. We get\n\\[\\text{Area}= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (2)(2\\sqrt{3}) + (-\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{8}) + (\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{6}) + (-\\sqrt{2})(-\\sqrt{8}) - (2\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{2}) - (-\\sqrt{2})(2) - (\\sqrt{6})(-\\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{8})(2) \\right| = 36.\\]\nTherefore, statement (B) is true. \n\nTo check statements (C) and (D), we note that the $x$-coordinate of the point of intersection of $T_1$ with the $x$-axis is the positive solution of $2x^2-12=0$, which is $x=\\sqrt{6}$. Similarly, the $x$-coordinate of the point of intersection of $T_2$ with the $x$-axis is $x=-\\sqrt{6}$. Therefore, statement (D) is true, but statement (C) is false. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct statements are (B) and (D)."

Note that $\\frac{x^2}{8}+\\frac{y^2}{20}<1$ is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-axes of length $\\sqrt{8}$ and $\\sqrt{20}$. The inequality $y^2<5x$ is the equation of a parabola opening to the right with vertex at the origin. We can graph both of these curves and shade the region that satisfies both inequalities to obtain the following diagram:\n\n[asy]\nsize(8cm);\nimport graph;\nimport olympiad;\n\nfilldraw(ellipse((0,0),sqrt(8),sqrt(20)),gray(0.7));\nfilldraw(arc((0,0),sqrt(5),0,atan(sqrt(20)/sqrt(8))),gray(0.9));\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,5),Arrow);\ndraw((-5,0)--(5,0),Arrow);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,5),N);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{x^2}{8}+\\frac{y^2}{20}=1$\",(2.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$y^2=5x$\",(3.5,3.5));\n[/asy]\n\nWe want to find the probability that three randomly chosen points in $X$ form a triangle whose area is a positive integer. We can do this by counting the number of triangles with positive integer area that can be formed from three points in $X$, and dividing by the total number of possible triangles.\n\nFirst, note that any triangle with vertices on the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{8}+\\frac{y^2}{20}=1$ will have non-integer area, since the semi-axes of the ellipse are not integers. Therefore, we must choose at least one vertex on the parabola $y^2=5x$.\n\nSuppose we choose one vertex $P$ on the parabola $y^2=5x$. Then the $x$-coordinate of $P$ must be a perfect square, and we can write $P=(a^2,5a)$ for some integer $a$. We want to count the number of lattice points in $X$ that can be used as the second vertex $Q$ of the triangle, such that $PQ$ is a side of the triangle and the area of the triangle is a positive integer.\n\nLet $Q=(b,c)$ be the second vertex. Then $PQ$ is a side of the triangle if and only if $b=a^2+k$ and $c=5a+m$ for some integers $k$ and $m$. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}|(a^2-k)(5a-m)|$. Since $a^2-k$ and $5a-m$ have opposite parity, the area is an integer if and only if $a^2-k$ and $5a-m$ are both odd or both even.\n\nWe can count the number of lattice points in $X$ that can be used as $Q$ by considering the possible values of $k$ and $m$ that satisfy the inequalities $\\frac{(a^2-k)^2}{8}+\\frac{(5a-m)^2}{20}<1$ and $(5a-m)^2<5(a^2-k)$. We can then use Pick's Theorem to count the number of lattice points in the region defined by these inequalities.\n\nAfter some algebraic manipulation, we find that the inequalities simplify to\n\\begin{align*}\nk^2-2a^2k+m^2-10am+20a^2&<0, \\\\\nm^2-10am+25a^2&<5k.\n\\end{align*}\nThe first inequality is the equation of an ellipse centered at $(a,5a)$ with semi-axes of length $\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\sqrt{5a^2-1}$. The second inequality is the equation of a parabola opening to the right with vertex at $(5a,a)$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(8cm);\nimport graph;\nimport olympiad;\n\nfilldraw(arc((0,0),sqrt(5),0,atan(sqrt(20)/sqrt(8))),gray(0.9));\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,5),Arrow);\ndraw((-5,0)--(5,0),Arrow);\nlabel(\"$a^2$\",(1,0),S);\nlabel(\"$a^2+1$\",(2,0),S);\nlabel(\"$a^2-1$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$5a$\",(0,5),W);\nlabel(\"$5a+1$\",(0,4),W);\nlabel(\"$5a-1$\",(0,3),W);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{(a^2-k)^2}{8}+\\frac{(5a-m)^2}{20}=1$\",(1.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$(5a-m)^2=5(a^2-k)$\",(3.5,3.5));\ndraw(ellipse((a,5a),sqrt(5),sqrt(5*a^2-1)),red);\ndraw((5a,0)--(5a,5a+1),dashed);\ndraw((5a,0)--(5a,5a-1),dashed);\ndraw((a^2+1,0)--(a^2+1,5a+1),dashed);\ndraw((a^2+1,0)--(a^2+1,5a-1),dashed);\ndraw((a^2-1,0)--(a^2-1,5a+2),dashed);\ndraw((a^2-1,0)--(a^2-1,5a-2),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nWe can count the number of lattice points in the region defined by these inequalities using Pick's Theorem. The boundary of the region consists of two line segments and two arcs of ellipses.

Therefore, the total number of lattice points in the region is\n\\[2a-1+4\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\sqrt{5a^2-1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+2\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+1.\\]\nNote that the expression inside the floor function is always an integer, since $a$ is an integer. Therefore, we can simplify the expression to\n\\[2a-1+2\\sqrt{5a^2-1}+2.\\]\nThis is the number of possible choices for $Q$ given a fixed choice of $P$. However, we have overcounted the number of triangles, since we have counted each triangle three times (once for each choice of vertex as $P$). Therefore, the total number of triangles with positive integer area is\n\\[\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty}\\left(2a-1+2\\sqrt{5a^2-1}+2\\right).\\]\nThis sum can be simplified as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty}\\left(2a-1+2\\sqrt{5a^2-1}+2\\right)&=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(2\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty}a-1+2\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty}\\sqrt{5a^2-1}+2\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty}1\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{(1+2)}{1}+2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{(5a^2-1)^{1/2}+5a^2-1-1}{5-1}+2\\cdot\\infty\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(3+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty}\\sqrt{5a^2-1}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(3+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{b=2}^{\\infty}\\sqrt{5b^2-5}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(3+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{b=2}^{\\infty}\\sqrt{5(b^2-1)}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(3+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{b=2}^{\\infty}\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{b-1}\\sqrt{b+1}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(3+\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\sum_{b=2}^{\\infty}\\sqrt{b-1}\\sqrt{b+1}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(3+\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\sum_{b=2}^{\\infty}\\sqrt"

The equation of the tangent to the parabola at $P$ is $y=-\\frac{1}{2a}(x-x_1)+y_1$. Therefore, the slope of the normal at $P$ is $m=2a(x-x_1)$. Since the normal passes through $Q$ and has slope $m$, its equation is $y=-\\frac{1}{m}(x-x_1)+y_1$. Setting $y=0$, we get $x_2=x_1+\\frac{y_1}{2a}$, which is the $x$-coordinate of $Q$. \n\nThe area of triangle $PFQ$ is $\\frac{1}{2}|x_1-a|\\cdot y_1$. Substituting $y_1^2=4ax_1$ and $x_2=x_1+\\frac{y_1}{2a}$, we get $$\\frac{1}{2}|x_1-a|\\cdot y_1=\\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\frac{y_1^2}{4a}-a\\right|\\cdot\\frac{y_1}{2\\sqrt{a}}=\\frac{1}{8a}\\left|y_1^2-4a^2\\right|.$$ Since $y_1^2=4ax_1$, we have $$\\frac{1}{8a}\\left|y_1^2-4a^2\\right|=\\frac{1}{8a}\\left|4ax_1-4a^2\\right|=\\frac{1}{2}|x_1-a|.$$ Therefore, the area of triangle $PFQ$ is $|x_1-a|^2=|y_1^2-4ax_1|$. \n\nSince $P$ lies on the parabola, we have $y_1^2=4ax_1$, so the area of triangle $PFQ$ is $|y_1^2-4ax_1|=0$. This means that $P$ lies on the directrix of the parabola, which is the line $y=-\\frac{a}{2}$. Therefore, $y_1=-\\frac{a}{2}$, and we have $x_1=\\frac{y_1^2}{4a}=\\frac{a^2}{8}$. \n\nThe slope of the normal at $P$ is $m=2a(x-x_1)=2a\\left(x-\\frac{a^2}{8}\\right)$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, we have $x-\\frac{a^2}{8}=1$ or $x-\\frac{a^2}{8}=2$. \n\nIf $x-\\frac{a^2}{8}=1$, then $x_1=\\frac{a^2}{8}-1$ and $y_1=-\\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting into $y_1^2=4ax_1$, we get $a^3-32a=0$, which gives $a=4$. Then $x_1=1$ and $y_1=-2$, so the slope of the normal at $P$ is $m=3$. Therefore, $(a,m)=(4,3)$ is a solution. \n\nIf $x-\\frac{a^2}{8}=2$, then $x_1=\\frac{a^2}{8}-2$ and $y_1=-\\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting into $y_1^2=4ax_1$, we get $a^3-128a=0$, which gives $a=8$. Then $x_1=2$ and $y_1=-4$, so the slope of the normal at $P$ is $m=4$. Therefore, $(a,m)=(8,4)$ is a solution. \n\nThus, the possible pairs $(a,m)$ are $(4,3)$ and $(8,4)$. Since $a$ is positive, the only valid pair is $(a,m)=\\boxed{(4,3)}$."

Let $d$ be the distance from the origin to the center of the sphere. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the sphere is $\\sqrt{1-d^2}$. Thus, the equation of the sphere is\n$$(x-\\alpha)^2+(y-\\beta)^2+(z-\\gamma)^2=1-d^2.$$\nSince this sphere intersects the plane $P$ at a distance of $\\frac{7}{2}$, we have\n$$\\left|\\sqrt{3}\\alpha+2\\beta+3\\gamma-16\\right|=\\frac{7}{2}.$$\nSquaring both sides and simplifying, we get\n$$12\\alpha\\sqrt{3}+16\\beta+24\\gamma-65=0.$$\nWe can now solve for $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$:\n$$\\alpha=\\frac{65-16\\beta-24\\gamma}{12\\sqrt{3}}.$$\nSubstituting this into the equation of the sphere, we get\n$$\\left(\\frac{65-16\\beta-24\\gamma}{12\\sqrt{3}}-x\\right)^2+(\\beta-y)^2+(\\gamma-z)^2=1-d^2.$$\nExpanding and simplifying, we get\n$$\\left(\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2(x^2-2\\cdot\\frac{65}{16}\\cdot x)+\\left(\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2(y^2-2\\beta y)+\\left(\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2(z^2-2\\gamma z)+\\left(\\frac{65}{3}\\right)^2+\\beta^2+\\gamma^2-1+d^2=0.$$\nComparing this to the general equation of a sphere $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2=r^2$, we see that $a=\\frac{65}{16}$, $b=0$, $c=0$, and $r=\\frac{16}{3}\\sqrt{1-d^2}$.

                        "content": "The line $\\ell_1$ is parallel to the vector $\\hat{i}+\\hat{j}+\\hat{k}$ and passes through the origin. Therefore, any plane $H$ that contains $\\ell_1$ must have a normal vector perpendicular to $\\hat{i}+\\hat{j}+\\hat{k}$. Let $\\vec{n} = a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}$ be the normal vector of $H$. Then, the equation of $H$ is given by $a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0)=0$, where $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is a point on $\\ell_1$.\n\nSince $\\ell_2$ is not parallel to $\\ell_1$, it intersects $H$ at a point $P$. Let $Q$ be the point on $\\ell_2$ closest to $P$. Then, $d(H)$ is the distance between $P$ and $Q$. Note that $P$ lies on $H$, so $P$ can be written as $(x_0,y_0,z_0)+t(a,b,c)$ for some $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Similarly, $Q$ can be written as $(1,t,t)$ for some $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe distance between $P$ and $Q$ is given by $\\frac{|(a,b,c)\\cdot(1-x_0,t-y_0,t-z_0)|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$. To maximize $d(H)$, we want to minimize the numerator. Therefore, we want $(a,b,c)$ to be parallel to $(1-x_0,t-y_0,t-z_0)$. Since $(1,0,0)$ and $(0,1,-1)$ are parallel to $(1-x_0,t-y_0,t-z_0)$, we can choose $\\vec{n}$ to be a linear combination of these vectors. Specifically, we can choose $\\vec{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,0,0) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(0,1,-1)$.\n\nLet $H_0$ be the plane with normal vector $\\vec{n}$ that contains $\\ell_1$. Then, $H_0$ is the plane that maximizes $d(H)$. To find $d(H_0)$, we need to find the point $Q$ on $\\ell_2$ closest to $P$. Since $P$ lies on $H_0$, we have $a(x_0-1)+b(y_0)+c(z_0)=0$ and $a(x_0)+b(y_0-1)-c(z_0)=0$. Solving for $x_0,y_0,z_0$ in terms of $a,b,c$, we get $x_0 = \\frac{a}{a+2b+2c}$, $y_0 = \\frac{b}{a+2b+2c}$, and $z_0 = \\frac{c}{a+2b+2c}$. Substituting these into the equation for $Q$, we get $Q = \\left(\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$. Therefore, $d(H_0) = \\frac{|(a,b,c)\\cdot(-1,2,2)|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nNow, we can find the answers to the questions:\n\n(P) The value of $d(H_0)$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{(B) \\quad (P) \\rightarrow(5)}$.\n\n(Q) The distance of the point $(0,1,2)$ from $H_0$ is $\\frac{|a(0-1)+b(1-1)+c(2-1)|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}} = \\frac{|a+c|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$. Since $\\vec{n}$ is perpendicular to $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{k}$, we have $a=c$, so the distance is $\\frac{2|a|}{\\sqrt{2a^2+b^2}}$. Substituting $\\vec{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,0,0) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(0,1,-1)$, we get $\\boxed{(B) \\quad (Q) \\rightarrow(4)}$.\n\n(R) The distance of the origin from $H_0$ is $\\frac{|a(0)+b(0)+c(0)|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}} = 0$, so the answer is $\\boxed{(B) \\quad (R) \\rightarrow(3)}$.\n\n(S) The point of intersection of planes $y=z$ and $x=1$ is $(1,t,t)$ for some $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The distance between this point and the origin is $\\sqrt{1+t^2+t^2} = \\sqrt{2t^2+1}$. To find the minimum value of this distance subject to the constraint that the point lies on $H_0$, we can use Lagrange multipliers. Let $f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = ax+by+cz$. Then, we want to minimize $f(x,y,z)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y,z) = 0$. The Lagrange multiplier equations are $\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g$ and $g(x,y,z) = 0$. Solving, we get $x = \\frac{a}{2a+b+c}$, $y = \\frac{b}{2a+b+c}$, $z = \\frac{c}{2a+b+c}$, and $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2a+b+c}$. Substituting $\\vec{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,0,0) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(0,1,-1)$, we get $a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $b=c=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$. Therefore, $t = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{2}}$, and the distance is $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{9}+1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{11}}{3}$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{(B) \\quad (S) \\rightarrow(1)}$."

Plugging in the values for the gas mixture, we get:\n\n$C = \\frac{3}{2} R \\left(\\frac{5/3}{2/3}\\right) + \\frac{5}{2} R \\left(\\frac{7/5}{2/5}\\right) = \\frac{29}{6} R$\n\nNow we can use the fact that the gas mixture is heated at constant pressure to find $\\Delta T$:\n\n$Q = nC\\Delta T = \\frac{P_0}{k_B N_A} \\cdot \\frac{29}{6} R \\cdot \\Delta T$\n\nWe can solve for $\\Delta T$:\n\n$\\Delta T = \\frac{6}{29} \\cdot \\frac{k_B N_A}{P_0} \\cdot \\frac{Q}{R}$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$\\Delta T = \\frac{6}{29} \\cdot \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot 6.02 \\times 10^{23}}{P_0} \\cdot \\frac{66}{8.31} \\approx 0.002 P_0$\n\nFinally, we can use the first law of thermodynamics to find the change in internal energy:\n\n$\\Delta U = Q - W = \\frac{P_0}{k_B N_A} \\cdot \\frac{29}{6} R \\cdot \\Delta T - 66$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$\\Delta U = \\frac{P_0}{k_B N_A} \\cdot \\frac{29}{6} R \\cdot 0.002 P_0 - 66 \\approx -0.5 P_0$\n\nSince the final answer must be a non-negative integer, we can assume that $P_0$ is a multiple of 2, since there are two moles of the monatomic gas. Let's assume that $P_0 = 2$ atm. Then we get:\n\n$\\Delta U \\approx -0.5 \\cdot 2 \\approx -1$\n\nTherefore, the change in internal energy of the gas mixture is approximately -1 Joule."

Mathematically, $Z = \\frac{V_{\\text{actual}}}{V_{\\text{ideal}}}$. \n\nGiven that the gas has a compressibility factor of 0.5, we can write:\n\n$$0.5 = \\frac{V_{\\text{actual}}}{V_{\\text{ideal}}}$$\n\nAt the same temperature and pressure, if the gas behaved ideally, its molar volume would be given by the ideal gas law:\n\n$$PV = nRT \\implies V_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{nRT}{P}$$\n\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $n$ is the number of moles of gas, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nWe are given that the molar volume of the gas is $0.4 \\mathrm{~dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ at a temperature of $800 \\mathrm{~K}$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$V_{\\text{actual}} = 0.4 \\mathrm{~dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the compressibility factor, we get:\n\n$$0.5 = \\frac{0.4 \\mathrm{~dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}}{\\frac{nRT}{P}}$$\n\nSolving for $P$, we get:\n\n$$P = \\frac{2nRT}{0.4 \\mathrm{~dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}} = 5nRT \\mathrm{~atm}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the molar volume of the gas if it behaved ideally at the same temperature and pressure. Using the ideal gas law, we can write:\n\n$$V_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{nRT}{P} = \\frac{0.4 \\mathrm{~dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}}{5} = 0.08 \\mathrm{~dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$$\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{P}{V_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{5nRT}{0.08 \\mathrm{~dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}} = \\frac{5 \\times 1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\times 8 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~L~atm~K}^{-1} \\times 800 \\mathrm{~K}}{0.08 \\mathrm{~L}} = \\boxed{5 \\times 10^{4}}$."

To find the null space, we row reduce the augmented matrix $\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right)$:\n$$\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right)$$\nThis shows that the null space is $\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$, since the only solution to $M\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$ is $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, statement (C) is false.\n\n(D) To check if $(M-2I)$ is invertible, we can calculate its determinant:\n$$\\det(M-2I)=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1\\end{array}\\right|=(-1)\\cdot(-1)\\cdot(-1)=1$$\nSince the determinant is nonzero, $(M-2I)$ is invertible. Therefore, statement (D) is true.\n\nIn summary, the correct statements are (A), (B), and (D)."

The function $f(x)$ is differentiable on each of the four intervals $0 < 4x < 1$, $1 \\leq 4x < 2$, $2 \\leq 4x < 3$, and $3 \\leq 4x < 4$. The only possible points of non-differentiability are the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$.

Therefore, $f(x)$ is differentiable at all points in $(0,1)$.\n\n(D) The minimum value of the function $f$ is $-\\frac{1}{512}$.\n\nTrue. To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we can look for critical points in $(0,1)$. We already found that $f'(x)$ is continuous on $(0,1)$ except possibly at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$. At any other point $x\\in(0,1)$, $f'(x)$ exists and is equal to\n$$f'(x)=2x^3 - \\frac{3}{2}x^2 + \\frac{5}{16}x - \\frac{1}{32}$$\nSetting $f'(x)=0$, we get\n$$2x^3 - \\frac{3}{2}x^2 + \\frac{5}{16}x - \\frac{1}{32} = 0$$\nThis cubic equation has one real root in $(0,1)$, which can be found using numerical methods to be approximately $x\\approx 0.198$. We can check that this is a local minimum by computing the second derivative:\n\\begin{align*}\nf''(x) &= 6x^2 - 3x + \\frac{5}{16} \\\\\nf''(0.198) &\\approx 0.238 > 0\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $x=0.198$ is a local minimum of $f(x)$ in $(0,1)$. We can also check the endpoints:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(0) &= 0 \\\\\nf(1) &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the minimum value of $f(x)$ in $(0,1)$ is $-\\frac{1}{512}$,"

Since the vertices of the triangle lie on a circle of radius 1, we have $a = 2R \\sin A$, $b = 2R \\sin B$, and $c = 2R \\sin C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the angles of the triangle and $R$ is the radius of the circumcircle.\n\nSince the difference between the largest and smallest angles is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $A - C = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or $B - C = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Without loss of generality, assume that $A - C = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Then we have $\\sin A = \\cos C$ and $\\cos A = \\sin C$, so $a = 2R \\cos C$ and $c = 2R \\sin C$. Since the sides are in arithmetic progression, we have $b = \\frac{a+c}{2} = R(\\cos C + \\sin C)$.\n\nBy the Law of Cosines, we have $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A$, so $4R^2 \\sin^2 C = 4R^2 (\\cos C + \\sin C)^2 + 4R^2 \\cos^2 C - 8R^2 \\cos C \\sin C \\cos A$.

Since the inradius $r$ of the triangle is given by $r = \\frac{A}{s}$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle and $s$ is the semiperimeter, we have $A = rs$. The area of the triangle can be computed using Heron's formula as $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $s = \\frac{3R+\\sqrt{3}R}{2} = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{2}R$ and $A = \\sqrt{\\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{2}R \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}R \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}R \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}R} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}R^2$. Therefore, $r = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}R^2}{\\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{2}R} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})^{-1} \\approx \\boxed{0.68}$."
